Dear Râ€™ Menachem,

I wanted a number of sources to our discussion.

First, the question of where to measure the width of the thumb -- either at knuckle which is the widest point (2.4 cm), or nearer to the tip which is narrower (2 cm) -- is found in Tosfos at the bottom of Menachos 41b [1,2]. 

Second, as Rabbi Chavel points out in his edition to the Ramban on Chumash, the Ramban wrote to his son . Typically, the easiest place to find the Ramban's account of the episode is in the back of Chumash Devarim of the Ramban Al ha'Torah. The paragraph begins "Birchani Hashem" [3]. 

Third and finally, you can see Rav Kook's writings in the references below [4,5].

Best wishes,
Yishai Rasowsky
