Sukah 020: Tosfos DH ha'Yashen

Daniel Gray <dgray@ustaxservices.ca> asks:

"Aval l'Inach Amora'ei d'Paslei Mishum Ohel" - Lashon Rabim refers to multiple other opinions on daf yud that invalidate bc of ohel, when in fact only one such opinion exists-Rav Huna, the other opinion dissenting with Shmuel disqualifies due to Makom Chashiv!?

The Kollel replies:
Dear Daniel,
Great to hear from you. It really is a good question you are asking. At the moment, I can only suggest this. The opinions of Rav Huna and Rav Chisda on Daf 10 are both based on the fact that the upper Sukah constitutes a sufficiently high roof to invalidate the lower Sukah. So Tosfos articulates both their views in terms of "Ohel". The only difference between them is from where to learn the amount. Rav Huna learns 1 Tefach from *Tumas* Ohel, whereas Rav Chisda learns 4 Tefachim from Reshuyos of Shabbos. An objection to what I am saying might be this: Tosfos should have used the word Sukah instead of Ohel, since the Pesul on Daf 10 under discussion is "Sukah under another Sukah", and not "Sukah under another Ohel". Perhaps that way of phrasing it would be misleading, since the area betwee the lower and upper rooves really does not constitute a valid Sukah. 
I would love to find a better answer, but I this helps for now. 
Best wishes,
Yishai Rasowsky

Dear Daniel,
I feel that the explanation I wrote has a support based on the comment of the Ritva on Daf 10. Because he writes according to Rav Chisda that the requirement is for Ohel, albeit a larger size than that of Tumas Ohel. I will share a link to it in the footnote [1].
Best wishes,
Yishai Rasowsky
