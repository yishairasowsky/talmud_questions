Our speaker today is Rabbi Binyamin Zev Cohn, 
He lives in Yerushalayim, 
He is currently studying for Semicha in איסור והיתר. 
Rabbi Cohn is also currently writing his first book titled "The Golden Calf Phenomenon" about making sense of multiple stories in The Torah and Nevi'im, showing how every instance of failure, -- starting from Adam HaRishon, to the עגל at הר סיני, Yeravam's עגלים,  David and Batsheva, The חורבן of ירושלים, Jesus, Shabbetai Zvi, and until today -- all point to one concept.  
He is am also fascinated by the Gemara's interpretation of  תנ"ך, and how it compares with the Kabbalah's interpretation, namely, the Kabbalah of the Ramchal. 
Rabbi Cohn also wrote an unpublished essay about Jewish astrology.

Nedarim 029: Question on Bar Pada

Avrumi Hersh <0586978970a@gmail.com> asks:

29b
Bottom line

Why does the gemoro ask this shaale (2 prutos marry, divorce, marry) only according to Bar Pada. The question is equally applicable to ulla and to abaye and rovo (bottom of 28b)   they are only arguing about the pidyon after ketztiza. But before ketzitza everyone agrees that you have to keep being podeh, again and again.

The Kollel replies:
Shalom,
Great to hear from you. Baruch Shekivanta! This point hinges on an important dispute amongst the commentaries. Some actually maintain that Ula does not agree to Bar Pada regarding the automatic resanctification after the saplings are redeemed (The Ran in his second explanation on 28b DH veha'Chacham ha'Gadol). According to this, we can understand why the Gemara on 29b-30a only tries to resolve the question of Rav Hoshaya based on Bar Pada, and not based on Ula. 
But others believes that Ula agrees to Bar Pada, like you appear to be assuming in your question (see the Ran 28b DH v'Kasav ha'Rashba). See the Rosh at the bottom of 29b who explains that indeed Ula would agree, but we are just mentioning Bar Pada's name because he is the one who spoke out this Halachah.
I hope this helps.
Happy Chanukah!
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky
