Bava Kama 087: Nezikin to Nochrim

EZ Gross <ezgrosss@gmail.com> asked: 

Hi

5. Is there any difference between a Nochri and a Ger Toshav when it comes to Nezikin or death?
including Tza'ar, Sheves, etc.?

Thanks you so much for all your help

The Kollel replies:
Shalom R' Eli,
Great to hear from you.
It appears from the Minchas Chinuch (51:1 DH v'Shor) that they are the same, at least regarding Mamon ha'Mazik, and arguably all the other laws you mentioned as well.
I hope this helps!
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky

ADDITION:
I see a bit more about the subject now, and I believe the following this would also interest you.
1) Capital Punishment for Murder b'Mezid
It appears from Rambam (Rotzeach 2:11) that the law is the same regarding a Jew who murders a Ger Toshav or murders a Goy. In both cases, there is no punishment administered by the Beis Din. See Kesef Mishnah who cites as the source of this ruling the Mechilta of Rebbi Yishmael (21:14 DH Ish) which discusses the alternative punishment from heaven.
2) Cities of Refuge for Murder b'Shogeg
Moreover, the Torah (Bamidbar 35:15), the Mishnah and Gemara (Makos 8b), and the Rambam (Rotzeach 5:3-4) teach us that the cities of refuge provide protection for a Ger Toshav who b'Shogeg kills another Ger Toshav. Vis a vis your question, it is important to note that this priviledge is *not* afforded to a Goy who worships idols.
2) If the Gentile is Murdered b'Shogeg
On the other side of the coin, the Minchas Chinuch (410:1 DH she'Nitzavu) cites a Machlokess reagrding whether there is a difference between an Akum and Ger Toshav when they are the victims of murder at the hands of a Jew who kills him b'Shogeg. Rambam (ibid. Halachah 3) writes that the Jew is *exiled* to the Ir Miklat if he kills a Ger Toshav b'Shogeg. The Rahamach agrees with the Rambam. The Ra'avad disagrees, as does the Kesef Mishnah who even maintains that the Girsa in the Rambam must be a mistake.
