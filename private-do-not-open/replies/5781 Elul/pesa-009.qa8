Pesachim 009: Ein Safek Motzi mi'Yedei Vadai

Soheil Zaman <szaman26@gmail.com> asks:

At the end of the day, why do we even say "Ein safeik motsi midi vadai"? Is it a svara, Rabbanan, or doraisa?

Second, lechora, the safeik we are dealing with is not simply a safeik hashakul - it's similar to a rov. So why can't rov win over a vadai? I didn't really think this is an important question, but it really changes our understanding of how we posken safeiks. At the end of the day, The Torah doesn't care that there one thing has a greater chance of being mutar and that's why we make it mutar. Poskening sfeikas in lumdus doesn't have anything to do with percentage. We do use percentage, but that's not the essentila factor.

Here's an example. I always though that the reason why we say sfeik sfeika doraisa we go l'kula, because well there's a greater chance of heter than isur (as opposed to a regular safeik doraisa. But it's not true. We see from ein safeik motsi midi vadai that even though chances are in neima achaltei the chulda will eat the chametz, the Torah doesn't care.

I can show you Rav two other places, once on daf 9b and once on daf 10a where statistics doesn't matter at all.

1) 9b - In teisha tsiburin Rashi says the kasha is do we require bedika or not. Tosfos says we don't because the house has a chezkas badok. The Yet in the second case of shnei kupos, the Gemara itself doesn't use a chazaka to machria the safeik - it uses this principle called sh'ani omer. Even though the statistics in both cases are the same, one you can use a chazaka but the other you can't. This shows that statistics is not the operating principle here.

2) 10a - In the case of ����� ���, Rashi seems to learn the machlokes beteween Rebbi Rav Eliezer and the Rabbanan is do we consider the chatzer of a person's house a separate reshus whereby we can consider that a proper sfeik sfeika to posken l'mutar. Rav Eliezer says yes, so you have a safeik if the akbar entered the house and a safeik that it ate it. Rabbanan disagree and hold that a chatzer is not a proper reshus. But at the end of the day, we the statistics are the same for both tanaim, yet there is still a technical machnlokes of what is considered a reshus or not. So again we see stats don't matter.

So my quesion is two-fold (it might actually just be one question):

1) If the Torah does not care about statistics, then what does it care about to posken safeiks?

2) What makes a sfeik sfeika a stronger safeik than 1 safeik if we don't care about the stats?

The Kollel replies: 
Dear R' Soheil,
Great to hear from you. Very excellent questions. 
Regarding the source of Ein Safeik Motzi Midei Vadai, it is indeed a Svara. It definitely appies to Torah laws. Commentaries disagree whether it applies to Rabbinic laws: Some says yes [1], others says no [2].
Regarding your very strong question about why Rov can't win over a Vadai, some say that can only be done for a Rov which is naturally occurring, but not for a Rov that is based on a person's decision [3]. 
Regarding your point about Sfeik Sfeika having a greater chance of Heter, the Rashba writes [4] that it is because of Rov. But the commentaries disagree whether that means a majority of potential cases of statistical chances [4a]. 
Others explain Sfeik Sfeika l'Kula is based on the regular rule of Safek d'Rabanan [5].
Still others explain Sfeik Sfeika l'Kula as a Gezeras Hakasuv, since the Torah only mandates Safek d'Oraisa l'Chumra in a case of one Safek, but not in a case of two Sfeikos. According to this, Sfeik Sfeika l'Kula is not proving as a fact that the status is Mutar; rather it is just a Psak that we are allowed to rely on that Tzad.
Forgive me if I am writing things that were already obvious to you. But I hope this is a helpful start. 
Best wishes,
Yishai Rasowsky
