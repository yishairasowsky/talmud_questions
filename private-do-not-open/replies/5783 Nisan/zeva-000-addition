The Kollel replies:

Shalom Chaim-Meyer,
Great to hear from you. I do see that the Gemara in Chulin 24a indicates that there is not much limitation on the age range for a Kohen. He does have to be a man rather than a boy, i.e. physically mature (two hairs; see Rashi DH Misheyavi). Also, once he is so old and weak that his body quivers, he is not fir to serve anymore (see Chulin 24b, Rashi DH She'Yiratet). 
Incidentally, you will see in that same Gemara that there is a restricted age range during which a *Levi* may serve, including five years of training from age 25 to 30 during which he learns the laws of the Avodah.
I hope this helps!
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky

ADDITION:
Notwithstanding the age limitations that we discussed above, there are instances where we see the young Kohanim -- even as children under Bar Mitzvah -- participating in Beis Hamikdash activities, sometimes to assist parts of the service, thought not Avodah per se. For instance, in Maseches Sukkah (Mishnah 5:2; Daf 51), we learn that the children Kohanim would climb the talls ladders to deposit oil into the Menorahs which would burn for the Simchas Beis Hashoeivah celebration. Other examples where the Pirchei Kehunah play a role in the Beis Hamikdash are found in the following: Midos 3:8 regarding climbing the golden chains to glimpse the crowns of the Heichal; Sanhedrin 9:6 regarding the punishment of a Kohen who served whilst impure; Yoma 1:7 regarding the effort to keep the Kohen Gadol awake all night of Yom Kippur; Tamid 1:l regarding sleeping on the floor in the Beis Hamokeid.
