Beitzah 017: Tamei Water

Joshua Danziger <jrdanziger@gmail.com> asks:

Hello kollel!

The mishna discusses a person making water tahor via hashaka provided it’s not in a kli that becomes tahor too.

Perhaps a simple question: since the beraisa allows drawing water from a well why doesn’t the person just pour the tamei water into the Mikva and draw new fresh water. Seems like it’s mechanically easier and gets to the same end point of tahor water in the kli.

Thank you.

Josh

The Kollel replies:

Shalom R' Danziger,
Wonderful to hear from you. I think your suggestion is potentially valid. I just have two concerns: One Halachic and another is practical. 
The Halachic concern is that maybe we cannot necessarily infer that drawing water from a Mikvah is Mutar just because it is Mutar to draw water from a well. The reason it is Mutar from the well is because that is the normal fashion of drawing water and therefore the situation doesn't appear as though the individual is intending for Taharah. See Rashi 18a DH Mitoch.
The practical concern is that in a typical case, the water in a Mikveh may be unappetizing if not impotable. Therefore, while you rightly identified certain advantages to your alternative procedure, nevertheless the individual wouldn't want to forfeit the presumably high-quality water in his possession. Hashakah, on the other hand, only involves a small amount of contamination of bad water into the good. 
Still, if the water quality is not a concern -- either because this is a very clean Mikveh or because the individual is not Makpid to have a clean supply of Tahor water -- then this concern doesn't apply.
Again I appreciate your insightful suggestion!
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky

ADDITION:
Shalom R' Danziger,
Since we discussed the issue of Mikvah water potentially being dirty, I thought it would be interesting to share a  few points related to the cleanliness of a Mikvah.
First, the Mishnah at the end of the second Perek of Mikvaos discusses under what scenarios and quantities of mud are allowed to coexist in the Mikvah water. 
Second, the Gemara in Shabbos 14a relates a discussion between Abaye and Rava regarding the phenomenon of Tevilah water -- albeit in a cave, not a Mikvah per se -- was so unpleasant/smelly that people began to mistakenly think that the subsequent bathing in Mayim Sheuvim is what effected the Taharah.
Third, there is a whole industry devoted to successfully preserving the hygiene and cleanliness of Mikvah water despite the fact that so many people use it repeatedly. For example, a company called MikvahTech has been responsible for innovating technology to enable oxidation/disinfection of Mikvah water, and creating a filter system that cleanses whilst maintaining Hashakah to the water residing in the Bor.
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky
