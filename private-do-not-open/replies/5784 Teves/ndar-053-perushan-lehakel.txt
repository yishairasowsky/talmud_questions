Nedarim 053: Ran DH Safek Isura l'Chumra

Paul Davidowitz <pdavidow@fastmail.fm> asks:

>>Ran bottom of 53a-
>>6) Ran DH Safek Isura l'Chumra-
(j) Gemara: It is a Safek Isur; we are stringent.
1. Explanation: Since there is a minority who use that species, there is a doubt Ц perhaps he intended even for these.<<

I do not see the chidush, being that it is already a fundamental principle that for Torah level doubt go strict.
And nedarim are Torah level.

Paul Davidowitz<<

The Kollel replies:

>>Shalom R' Davidowitz,
Your question is really making me think hard. I want to check more what additonal Mefarshim say about this subtle point you are raising!
But to me at this moment, it seems that the initial premise of the Gemara was that the rule Safek Isur l'Chumra only applies when the two sides of the Safek are comparable. But if one type is only a minority, then one can ignore it; we simply assume like the majority, as one generally follows Rov in Halachah. 
But the Chidush here is that it is indeed Asur, the reason being because there is an appreciable chance -- let's say 50/50 -- that maybe the speaker himself intended to take into account even the alternative behavior of that minority of the population. 
Warmest regards,

Paul asks:

What?! The nodair knew what he was doing when taking the neder.

The Kollel replies:
Shalom R' Davidowitz!
I think you are right and I was mistaken. As I look back at what I wrote, my words suggest that we are concerned with a doubt over what the person actually meant when he declared his Neder. But after reading your insight, I believe it would be closer to the truth to say the following. It may well be clear as day in his own mind what he meant. But Devarim She'bileiv Einam Devarim . So our concern is what do his actual words indicate. Well, the Hava Amina thought that, regardless of what the individual meant, his words should be interpreted as applying only to the majority variety of oil, based on the rule of Azlinan Basar Rov. But the Maskana believes that his words should be interpreted as applying to the majority and minority varieties of oil. Various rationales for that final position should appear in another reply that I submitted to be sent to you a short time ago. Yasher Koach for helping me to see this issue more clearly.
Warmly,
Yishai Rasowsky

Addition (Re: Stam l'Hakeil)
Shalom R' Davidowitz,
I mistakenly overlooked an important Klal that might help resolve part of our issue. It appears in the Mishnah (Nedarim 18b), and it says that "Stam Nedarim l'Hakeil, u'Peirusham l'Hachmir." This is understood to mean that if a person claims that he meant something specific when he made his vow, then he is believed. But when he does not know, or it is not clear what he meant at the time of vowing, it is then that we face questions of ambiguity of language, e.g. what does the exact phrase mean etc. So, in our case, if he knows which oil he was talking about, then we can rely and what he claims to have intended. But if we cannot determine that, for example if he forgot or doesn't know, or even if he didn't think anything specific at the time of his vow then we would resort to the rules of interpretation that the Mishnah sets forth, which can lead to a stringent ruling which forbids both types of oil.
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky
