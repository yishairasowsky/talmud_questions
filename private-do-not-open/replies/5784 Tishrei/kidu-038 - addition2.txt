Kidushin 038: Manna

Daniel Sheinfil <daniel.sheinfil@gmail.com> asks:

Gmar chasima Tovah!
Bkvod Harav

On daf 38a in Kiddushin, the gemara explaina that from Moshe Rabbeinu petira, the yidden ate the manna from their vessels until they entered eretz yisrael
v'Hayu Mistapkin mi'Man she'B'Keilim Ad Shishah Asar b'Nisan
והיו מסתפקין ממן שבכלים עד ששה עשר בניסן
1. How could they keep the manna overnight?
2. How did they have enough for those many days when the manna fell daily sufficient for only that day (sans Erev Shabbos)?
3. Even if they did keep it, it and perhaps more than a days worth fell on zayin Adar, wouldn't it have spoiled?

Thank you.

The Kollel replies:
Shalom R' Sheinfil,
Great to hear from you.
1. You are right that in Shemos 16:19 we are commanded not to leave the Mann over to the next morning. One is tempted to think, however, that this law only applies when there will be a new supply of Mann coming the next day. In our case, since the Mann was going to stop falling, there will ostensibly be no prohibition to leaving some over to the next day.
2. The simple understanding appears to be that it was by means of a miracle that the limited amount of Mann they must have possessed could have lasted 39 additional days from 7 Adar until 16 Nisan. 
3. When it spoiled Shemos chapter 16, it was by divine miracle, because Hashem didn't want them to eat on a subsequent day from the Mann supply gathered on the previous day. So, in our case, when Hashem did want them to continue eating from their supply of Mann, he willed that it should not spoil the morning after.
Warmest regards,

ADDITION:
Shalom R' Sheinfil,
I just looked in the Mesivta volume of Kidushin 38, and I see that they cite commentaries who address your question. 
1. Pardes Yosef (Shemos 16:25 DH b'Ohr ha'Chaim) cites Ambuha d'Sifrei (b'Haalosecha #23) based on the Safek of the Sefas Emes (brought in Chedvas Yaakov, Mahdura Tinyana, Siman 27) that there is no prohibition to leave over Mann that fell on Erev Shabbos. And according to Tosfos (Menachos 30a DH Mikan) Moshe Rabeinu passed away on Erev Shabbos. Therefore in this case they were allowed to leave it over. 
2. Alternatively, he suggests, there is only a prohibition to leave over the Mann if it will be falling each subsequent day, the purpose being to test the people's Bitachon in Hashem. Therefore after it stopped falling they were allowed to leave it over. 
3. The Brisker Rav (Chidushei ha'Griz, Shemos 16:35) offers two answers. His first answer overlaps with the previous idea: Once the Mann stopped falling, the laws of the Mann ceased to apply. Therefore the last batch that fell was permitted to remain indefinitely.
4. His second answer is that the ordinary rule to not keep Mann until the next day was overridden in this case because here it was God's specific desire for them to leave it over. 
5. In fact, on a related note, Pardes Yosef (Beshalach 16:16) says that the Torah's language limits the commandment to refrain from leaving over the Mann, and actually excludes the two cases where it was supposed to be left over, namely when Aharon was to preserve some as a Mishmeres (Shemos 16:33) and subsequent to the death of Moshe. 
Chag Sameach!

ADDITION #2:
Shalom R' Sheinfil, Moadim l'Simchah
Rav Kornfeld kindly shared with me an article of his which adds much clarity and insight to this issue. I want to share the link with you.
https://www.dafyomi.co.il/parsha/parsha-prep/parshaprep2.04-beshalach.pdf
And allow me to summarize the main additional points from that piece which we did not discuss. (All the references and citations are included in that article.)
1. Even if the Jewish people were *permitted* to leave over the Manna on the day of Moshe Rabeinu's passing, it still remains to be explained how they would have known they were supposed to do so. Did they know, after all, that the Manna would cease falling after Moshe passed away? Maharil Diskin writes that because Moshe passed away on either Friday or Shabbos, only a single portion of Manna would have rained down that Friday, instead of the normal double portion. This allowed the Jewish people to conclude that no more Manna would fall in the future.
2. According to Ibn Ezra, the prohibition to leave over Manna only would apply if it a person was leaving it over
to eat the following day. The reason being, because that would have expressed a lack of trust in Hashem. If, however, one left over Manna simply because he was not hungry, that would not have been prohibited. 
3. Moreover, it can be expected that the Jewish people did in fact limit their eating and drinking on that day, as an act of mourning, since Moshe their teacher passed away.
4. According to the Brisker Rav's approach that leaving over the Manna was permitted through Nevuah, it means that the prohibition to leave over Manna
was canceled while Manna still remained in existence. Accordingly one can understand the Rambam who writes that the prohibition to leave over the Manna is a Mitzvah which is *not* operative for all time, even though the Rambam himself holds that a Mitzvah which for technical reasons cannot be performed in future generations is *not* necessarily classified as a Mitzvah which is not operative for all time. Here, the Pshat would be that since the Mitzvah was annulled while the Manna existed, therefore it would indeed be the case that the Mitzvah does not apply forever.
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky
