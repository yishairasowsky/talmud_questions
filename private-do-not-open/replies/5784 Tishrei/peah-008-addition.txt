Pei'ah 008: Tzedakah

H David Levine <zoveighkuX@gmail.com> asks:

One of the thrift stores offers online auctions where gold and silver are often bid below the price of scrap.  But these things are donated for charitable benefit, and I took pause about capitalizing on them, since I am not in need of ma'aos tsedaka.  It appeared to me like issur.  What perhaps is the halacha?

The Kollel replies:
This is not a Psak Halachah.
Shalom R' Levine,
Great to hear from you. It would seem to depend on the terms and conditions of the auction. 
Frequently these events are organized in such a way the materials are donated with the full knowledge that they may be sold for less than the actual market price, because the charity organization would prefer to have cash quick quickly and conveniently rather than have the burden of having to sell each individual item at its more valuable market price. This is particularly relevant, since as you mentioned the items are donated. Therefore, when you pay them cash, it is very plausible that they are much happier to have the money instead of being stuck with a variety of items which they can't be bothered to sell for the higher market price. 
But I am assuming that the whole effort is meant to help the organization raise funds, and *not* necessarily for the "charitable benefit" of needy consumers who purchase the products e.g. gold/silver. If, for example, there were in fact some stipulation specifying that only needy people are entitled to purchase the items at the discount price, then it would be more questionable. 
By the way, I'm sure you thought of this, but I will add another aspect which I cannot determine whether it's relevant to your case. That is, that not all charities are equally legitimate. One can do the appropriate research to verify whether the money he's giving for a "charitable" cause is funding appropriate activities. For example, a great Posek once told me not to purchase from a certain thrift store, because -- as he put it -- to do so would be contributing funds towards Idolatry. Of course this is just an example, and I'm not insinuating that any problematic issues exist with the organization that you are discussing. 
Gmar Chasimah Tovah!
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky

ADDITION:
This is not a Psak Halachah.
Shalom, R' Levine,
It occurred to me that a consideration which may be related to your question — but that I failed to speak about — is that of Ona'ah. In this case, that would be the potential concern of underpaying for an item. But frankly, what I see discussed more commonly is the reverse case, in which the buyer feels he has overpaid. However, as Poskim discuss, whether Ona'ah applies to an auction at all would depend on a number of factors.
1. Does Ona'ah apply to an auction at all? Many cite Teshuras Shai 1:456 as positing that it does. However, a number of others argue with that for different reasons: the auction involves non-Jews and is conducted according to local secular law (see Sho’el U’maishiv, vol. IV, 3:137; Mishpat Shalom 227:15); often auctions deal with items whose true value is not known, and frequently, the intention when setting up the auction was to sell the item even if at a price that does not match the market value (see Pischei Choshen, Onaah 10:15).
2. Was there a mistake in the initial appraisal of the item's worth? See Nesivos ha'Mishpat (109:5) regarding whether this factor can reinstate the ability of one party to claim that there was Ona'ah.
Gmar Chasimah Tovah!
