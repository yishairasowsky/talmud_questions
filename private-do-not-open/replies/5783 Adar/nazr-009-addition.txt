Nazir 009: Beis shammai should make no distinction

Avrumi Hersh  <0586978970a@gmail.com> asks:

9b last line
The gemoro says that reb yochonon says, that chikiya should agree, that the chiddush of the mishna which says that "harey olay mincha from seorim" is not excluding adoshim, cos the chiddush by seorim is even bigger. The chiddush is that perhaps it's not a chazorah of his words "mincha" instead he means to say that originally he only agreed to a minchas nedovo of seorim and if that's not possible then he won't give anything. Km"l.

But why is that a chiddush, surely according to beis shammai the rule of hekdesh tous is, that you are chayav to do anything you say, even if you expressedly made a tnay, e.g. seorim or nothing. Just like beis shammai says if you made a tnay of a certain animal that comes out my house 1st and a totally different animal emerges, this is still hekdesh tous and it still works.  So acc. To chizkiya in beis shammai this is no extra chiddush at all. This is the same rules?

The Kollel replies:
Shalom R' Hersh,
Great to hear from you.
When he says he wants to bring a Minchah of lentils, it is relatively more obvious that he is Chayav to bring a wheat Minchah. The reason is because his words contained a glaring error. No one, after all, would actually think that a Minchah can be made from lentils. So, based on the premise that he must have intended something coherent, we can only assume that he was attempting to retract from his original commitment to bring a Minchah. But, in fact, he is not able to retract; therefore, he certainly remains Chayav to bring a Minchah. 
If, on the other hand, he says he wants to bring a Minchah of barley, it is relatively less obvious that he is Chayav to bring a wheat Minchah. The reason is because his words contain only a slight error. One could potentially be unaware that a Minchah should not be made from barley. But if so, then there is no reason to assume that he meant to commit himself to anything other than what he actually said, i.e. a barley Minchah. Since he cannot in fact bring this, therefore one might have thought that he remains exempt from brining the Minchah.
I hope this helps!
Where did you find that Beis Shammai's view regarding the individual who expressly makes a Tenai regarding which animal will come out of his house? Thanks!

Addition: 
I see you were referring to the Mishnah at the beginning of the fifth Perek. Although I do not have a full answer, I am nevertheless tempted to suggest three potential approaches to begin work at resolving the challenging point you are raising. 
1. The very "Chidush" of the ruling in the Mishnah may be exactly your point. In other words, the Tana is coming to teach us that we do not say "there is no Chiyuv because it was based on a mistake." Rather, the view being conveyed in our Mishnah, i.e. that of Beis Shammai, is that even when a person erred in their understanding of the situation when stipulating a Korban, it is nevertheless binding. 
a. A difficulty with this is that seemingly there would be no reason to teach such a Chidush in this Mishnah when it is already going to be taught explicitly in the Mishnah in chapter five. 
b. Possibly one could resolve this by saying that the Mishnah is not intending to inform us per se that this is Beis Shammai's view; but rather, as a matter of style, the Tana is Simply selecting the case which is indeed a greater Chidush, the reason for which is based on the Mishnah in chapter five. 
2. I believe your question is based on Daf 31a where the Gemara expresses its initial understanding of Beis Shammai's view. But Rav Papa rejects that view. Maybe our Gemara is in accordance with his interpretation of Beis Shammai. One, however, may object to this because it does not seem appealing to establish the Stam Gemara on Dapim 9b-10a like one opinion in a later Perek, especially if I do not see a clear comment to this effect in the Gemara or Rishonim. 
3. There is a difference between two types of declaration. One is declaring a particular item to become Kadosh, which Beis Shammai validates even though there was a mistake involved, such as by the Shor on Daf 31. The other is taking upon oneself the obligation to bring a future offering, such as the individual on Daf 9 who vows to bring a Minchah. Therefore, possibly, even if one were to hold that Hekdesh on a specific object will take effect even if the person who was Makdish made a mistake. For example, declaring that the Shor emerging from the house is Kadosh whilst being mistaken about the color. Nevertheless, one could still theoretically hold that taking on an obligation cannot take effect if the person vowing was under a mistaken impression. For example, if he vowed to bring a Minchah made of lentils. We see this distinction, by the way, in the context of the question raised by the Gilyon Ha'Shas on 9b. One may seriously question my argument, however, because as the Kashya of the Gilyon Ha'Shas makes clear, for some reason our Gemara does feel comfortable inferring from a case in which one declares an item to be Kadosh (vowing to be a Nazir from figs) to a case in which one takes upon himself an obligation (vowing to bring a barley Minchah).
Since I didn't find my proposed resolutions discussed in the commentaries, I cannot tell you that I have a definite answer right now. But for the time being I hope our discussion helps contribute to your fascinating analysis of this topic. Meanwhile, I will to defer to other members of the Kollel in case they are able to offer additional and help and insights on this challenege you raised.
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky
