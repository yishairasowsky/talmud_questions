Avodah Zarah 021: Lo Sechanem

Joel Greenberg <joelgreenberg613@gmail.com> asks:

The Rambam (hilchos avodei zara 10 6) says that the lav of lo yoshvu b'artzecha) is only when yad yisrael takifa.  The Pri Migadim (orech chaim 306, ashel avram sif katan 20 d"h baretz yirael)  applies this to the issur of lo sechanim.
How can he do this?  They are 2 separate issurim with nafkei minas (for example lo yoshvu will asur renting to a goy as well as the Ramabm writes in sefer hamitzvas but by lo sechanim we don't say that).  Just because the Rambam says that by lo yoshu b'aretech doesnt mean we will say that by lo sechanim?

The Kollel replies:
Shalom R' Greenberg,
Great to hear from you.
Baruch Shekivanta! I see your Svara to distinguish between the two laws in the Sefer Divrei Yirmiyahu commenting on that passage of the Rambam.
Baed on the words of the Pri Megadim, one is reminded of the Mehalech of the Sefer Teshuvos Shemen Hamaor, which I do not have on hand right now, wherein the author claims that there is only an Isur Lo Tichanem when most of Eretz Yisrael is in Jewish possession, but not in his day (late 19th century) when Eretz Yisrael was mostly in the hands of Akum anyway.
On the other hand, the Chazon notably made two objections to this: First, each piece of land could have its own Isur Lo Tichanem, so the fact that most of Eretz Yisrael belongs to gentiles doesn't take away the prohibition from a small portion of Eretz Yisrael that is in the hands of a Jew. And secondly, said the Chazon Ish, today (20th century) anyway it's not true, because most of Eretz Yisrael is in Jewish hands.
I hope this helps!
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky

ADDITION:
Shalom R' Greenberg,
I want to make comes corrections and additions about the some of the sources relevant to this discussion. I hope it helps expand and clarify how the opinion of the Pri Megadim might fit into the larger picture.
1. The view of the Shemen ha'Mor is in Y.D. Siman 4 and is cited in Tzitz ha'Kodesh Vol 1 16:3. It is not "Shemen ha'Maor" as I incorrectly wrote previously.)
2. The Sefer Avodah Berurah (Avodah Zarah, Volume 1, page 451) cites a number of views on this topic. It is available here: https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50945&st=&pgnum=496&hilite=
3. In the Collected Letters of Achiezer (Year 5697, Divrei Halachah #61-62), Rav Chaim Ozer writes that there is no Isur Lo Tichanem when gentiles anyway have possession of parts of Eretz Yisrael.
4. The Chazon Ish is in Sheviis Siman 24.
5. Toras Yehonasan (7:58) writes that if the gentile has other alnd in Eretz Yisrael logically it should be permitted to sell him more land. He bases this on a Diyuk from a Rambam (Hilchos Avodah Zarah 10:4) who writes that the reason for the Isur Lo Tichanem is so that the gentiles should not have a a permanent dwelling in Eretz Yisrael, which seems to imply that if they anyway have a dwelling space then there is no Isur. But the Toras Yehonasan himself did not want to be Matir on these grounds alone since he didn't find stronger explicit support from Rishonim. Chazon Ish (Y.D. 65:1 DH v'Ein) also forbids this.
6. The Ra'avan (Siman 290) maintains that if the government possesses dominion and authority over a person's house, then we can say the real estate is not under exclusive Jewish control, then the Isur Lo Tichanem does not apply. 
7. The Mesivta edition of Avodah Zarah (Daf 21) brings a number of views which hold that under various circumstances there is no Isur Lo Tichanem.
