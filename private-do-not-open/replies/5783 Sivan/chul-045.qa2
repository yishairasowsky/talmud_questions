Chulin 045: Missing Spinal Marrow

Mark May <poppopmay994@gmail.com> asks:

Chulin 45b. Missing Spinal Marrow.
In human anatomy, Marrow is contained in bone and would not refer to the neural contents or spinal cord.
In Human medical experience, a crushed spine (referring to the vertebrae) is compatible with life. Even an injury to the spinal cord (neural element) below the brain stem is compatible with life.
In an animal, an Injury to the spinal cord resulting in paralysis or loss of function of one or more limbs, I would think, would render the animal treifah (incompatible with surviving one year).

My confusion is with the Talmudic terminology presented in Chulin 45b.
Does Spinal Marrow refer to the Marrow in the vertebrae or neural substance in the spinal cord?
The rabbis in this sugya argue the amount of Marrow lost to determine whether an animal is treifah.
Please clarify for me.
Thank you.

Shalom,
Great to hear from you.

Dear Mark May,

Thank you for sharing your question and insights on the Gemara's discussion of Treifos. It's wonderful to see your specialized knowledge in this area, and I greatly appreciate your contribution to the topic. Please feel free to correct me if there's anything I mention below that needs further clarification or adjustment.

As you indicated, anatomically speaking, the spinal cord does not contain bone marrow; rather, it consists of nerve fibers, support cells, and cerebrospinal fluid.

Regarding the term "Moach" used in the Gemara, it is not referring to bone marrow specifically in our Sugya. Instead, it is used in a broader sense to represent the inner content or substance of something. In the context of this discussion, "Moach" denotes the neural tissue within the spinal cord.

Therefore, the Gemara's debate focuses on determining whether the majority referred to pertains to the nerve tissue itself ("Rov Mocho") or the protective membranes surrounding the spinal cord ("Rov Oro") i.e. the meninges.

From a medical standpoint, the two views presented in the Gemara are intriguing, since they are debating which aspect of the spinal cord holds greater significance in determining the viability of the animal; and modern medicine identifies the role of the nerve tissue as transmitting signals to and from the brain, while the meninges is there provide vital protection and support to the spinal cord.

I hope this helps!
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky
