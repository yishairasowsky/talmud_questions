Makos 005: Shem Eidim Zomemim

Joshua Danziger <jrdanziger@gmail.com> asks:

Hello kollel!

The Gemara discusses a case of eidim zomemim who testify on someone who had gmar din and it seems they aren’t punished.

My question is this. A shiur I listened to brought the brisker ravs approach that there is a status of eidim zomemim which one receives if they conspire. This relates to ideas of when they’re mafreah. I’d think in this case even though there’s gmar din, the witnesses should have “shem eidim zomemim” and even if not punished they’d have their prior testimonies invalidated etc.

Appreciate your clarification!

Josh

The Kollel replies:

Shalom R' Danziger,
Great to hear from you.
I didn't immediately locate where the statement of the Brisker Rav is found. If you would like to share a link to a recording of the Shiur you heard, I would be happy to listen to it. I believe your point is logical and correct: Even though in a particular scenario the Edim will not receive the punishment "Kaasher Zamam," nevertheless their testimonies will be Pasul since ultimately they were undermined by the latter witnesses. (As you might know, Abaye and Rava in Sanhedrin 27a dispute whether this Pesul applies only to their testimonies which were made after their being undermined, or to all testimonies subsequent to their false Edus.)
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky

ADDITION:
Shalom! I see in the Otzar Mefarshei ha'Talmud (Makos Daf 5, footnote 100) a couple of comments relevant to our discussion. 
First, the view of Rav Moshe Rozin in Nezer ha'Kodesh who himself remained in doubt regarding whether the first set of Edim actually become Pasul vis-a-vis their other testimonies. This is a Chidush in my eyes, because straight logic would seem to imply that there is no reason to validate the first set in our case any more than regular Edim Zomemim, regardless of the technicality whether they receive a punishment of Kaasher Zamam. 
They cite the view of the Meiri on our Sugya also. He maintains that the first and second set of witnesses are treated as Muchsheshes against one another. This means that although we know one set is lying, and therefore we must treat them with suspicion. However, we do not invalidate either set individually; we only do so if they join together, since then it would be certain that someone within the combined group is a liar. 
Warmest regards,
Yishai
