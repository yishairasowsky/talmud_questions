Kidushin 011: Counting units vs Weights

Avrahom  <evan.p.kevelson@gmail.com> asks:

When Tyre was stabilized under Ptolemy rule
The Tyrian shekels were highly reputed for their silver content of about 97%, much higher than other silver coins in the region. The aimed weight for the full shekel is estimated at around 14.1 gram. For the half shekel the aimed weight would then be half of this or around 7.1 gram. (50 Shekalim would be 705 grams or 0.7 kilograms of silver=50 shekel kesef.
The US market values 1 Oz of pure silver $24.24.
14.1 gm Tyre silver coin= 1/2 oz today 12.12 USD.
So to have true Havana research to the weight of a Tyre coin is needed.
Then for more accuracy in weight measurement conversions. So hypothetically motzee Sheim rah today would $12.12 USD x 150 or $1818 USD.


The most accurate account of Tyre utilized a Phoenician weight scale where pure silver was 1420 0z coin or 3.3 lbs.
So kenas for an Anus a betulah would be 150 lbs/ 68 Kg worth of pure silver based on those weights.
Most of the region the Seluicids used measurements later on there it was 1640 Oz.
But Tyre as a mint for the most part during Greece was under Ptolemy rule.

The Kollel replies:
Shalom R' Kevelson,
Great to hear from you.
It is amazing how you know so much about historical quantities and prices of silver. I was wondering why you multiplied by 150 in order to get the sum for Motzi Shem Ra. I was expecting we would multiply the quantity of silver by 100, because that is the amount due (Devarim 22:19); in other words, Mishkal Meah Selaim Kesef Mezukak (Rambam, Hilchos Naarah Besulah 3:1).

ADDITION:
Shalom R' Kevelson,
One of the first sources we might look to for authoritative clarity on this issue is the Rambam in Hilchos Shekalim 1:2 who defines the amount of silver weight prescribed for these quantities of Kenas. In terms of weight, he writes, it is equivalent to 320 barley seeds; but that Chazal increased that to coincide with the coin known as a Sela in the times of Bayis Sheini, the weight of which was 348 medium barley seeds. 
The Rambam in the Peirush ha'Mishnayos (Bechorot 8:8) elaborates on the measurement of this quantity. 
From a quick search, I see that roughly 1000 barley seeds have a mass of 40 grams. The market price for silver is roughly $0.80 per gram. This would mean, if I am not mistaken -- you are invited to correct me, of course  -- that for Motzi Sheim Ra, 100 Selaim, would come to roughly the following:
(100 Selaim) * (348 barley seeds/1 Sela) * (40 gram/1000 barley seeds) * ($0.80/gram), in other words *approximately* 1000 dollars.
By the way, as I think you can see, the above assumes that a Sela is around 14 grams.
But I see in the English Rambam by Rabbi Eliyahu Touger, he writes that in terms of modern measurements, a Shekel of the Torah is 16 grams of pure silver. Also, that common custom today is to give 96 grams of silver for the five Shekalim required for Pidyon ha'Ben. Accordingly, a Shekel is 19.2 grams. Moreover, according to the Piskei Siddur of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi a shekel is 20.4 grams.
So I do apologize for the remaining degree of inconsistency between the values, but I do hope our calculation helps to give some approximate sense of the amount of money with which we are dealing. 
Kesivah v'Chasimah Tovah!
Warmest regards,
Yishai Rasowsky
