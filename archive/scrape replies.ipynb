      "Great question. Rav Yonasan Eybeschutz (18th century Prague) writes in the Kreisi that normally after slaughtering an animal the reason blood streams out is because the veins and arteries are severed. But here, they were not severed, so blood didn't come out [1]. Like the commentaries before him [2], he writes that the Chidush is that it's not a problem that there is no opportunity for Kisuy ha'Dam. If that's the case, one might suggest that there was a degree of blood, just not enough to spill on the ground. I hope this helps!\n",

      "The Chasam Sofer writes [1], as you suggested, that this is not a dispute over the physical facts of nature. Both sides agree that the blood in the walls of the womb can be likened to a liquid being stored in a sponge. It is not exactly like typical blood of the circulatory system, since it is collected. Yet it is also not 100% separate from the flesh yet. So there are two ways of looking at it.\n",
      "Accordingly, When the blood is released as a result of the intimacy, there are two ways of viewing it: Either it is released because of the strong pressure that the man applies to the walls of the womb, in which case we should classify it as making a wound. This is \"Chaburei Michbar\". Or simply when the hymen breaks the blood flows out on its own, in which case it should not be classified as making a wound. This is \"Mifkad Pakid\".\n",

      "By the fact the Gemara brings chaveir sh'meis means to me that chulda and chaveir sh'meir is to a degree parallel. Rashi says that the case of chaveir sh'meis is a rov. So neima achaltei is a rov. The reason why rov does not work for chaveir sh'meis is because rov based on a natural phenomenon is stronger than a rov based on the way a person chooses to act, because a person can choose to act like the minority. He's a bar das. Thus I see the Gemara is telling me that rov could work well here but because the rov is dealing with the way a person acts, only a vadai would help. Which means IF THE ROV IS A NATURAL ROV, THEN IT COULD BEAT A VADAI.\n",

      "This Sugya is a very rich one. And I see that you formulated this question based your understanding of several steps in the Gemara. That is great! Can I suggest that your assertion regarding the distinction between a Rov based on human decision versus a Rov based on natural phenomenon is a point that would need to be proven, in order for your Kashya to be ironclad. Barring that someone reading this Gemara would in fact come to the conclusion that a simple Rov, even one based on animal behavior, is not enough to override the Vadai Isur. I would love to know your thoughts.\n",

That is, when you are combining one Tefach of wall with less-than-three Tefachim of airspace (\"Lavud\"), this results in a grand total of four Tefachim, which is the majority of the requisite seven [1]. But in Rav Yehudah's case, the Tefach was standing directly next to the full size wall, not 2.9 Tefachim away [2]; so there would be no reason for it be larger than a regular Tefach.\n",

      "Dear Emmanuel,\n",
      "Very nice question. Maybe it would help bring clarity if we distinguish between a few concepts: \n",
      "\n",
      "A. Material which itself is Pasul for Schach. \n",
      "For instance, all opinions agree this includes metal. What about Nesarim? \n",
      "According to Rav, Rebbe Yehudah says no, whereas Rebbe Meir says yes provided they are 4 Tefachim wide. \n",
      "But according to Shmuel, even Rebbe Yehudah says yes provided they are 4 Tefachim wide, whereas Rebbe Meir says yes even if they are 3 Tefachim wide. \n",
      "\n",
      "B. The amount of that Pasul material which will comprise an invalid area of the roof, for instance under which one may not sleep. This is 4 Tefachim. This is so even according to the view that the Gezeirah even applies to Nesarim that are only 3 Tefachim wide. \n",
      "If that seems odd, perhaps it would help to consider metal as an example. Even though metal poles, let's say 1 inch wide, are invalid for Schach, nevertheless they would not constitute an Pasul area, under which one may not sleep, unless a series of these metal poles, laid side by side, were to collectively occupy 4 Tefachim of width.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. The amount of that Pasul material which will invalidate *the entire Sukah*.\n",
      "According to Neharda'a [1], Shmuel says this is 4 Tefachim in the middle of the roof but 4 Amos at the edge, whereas Rav says it is 4 Amos whether near the edge or in the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this we can resolve the questions I understood you to be asking:\n",
      "I. If the Nesarim are 4 Tefachim wide, then why according to Rav is the space under the Nesarim not Kosher, if according to Rav the Schach is Pasul only if we have 4 Amos? The answer is that 4 Tefachim of Schach Pasul already comprises an area unfit e.g. for sleeping, whereas 4 Amos is the amount of Schach Pasul that is Posel the entire Sukah (see C above).  \n",
      "II. Why when the Nesarim are 3 Tefachim is it Kosher under the Nesarim, but when the Nesarim are 4 Tefachim it is not Kosher under the Nesarim? The answer is that even those who hold that Nesarim 3 Tefachim wide constitute a material which is invalid for Schach, nevertheless only when that material occupies a width of 4 Tefachim does that portion of the roof actually become Pasul (see B above). \n",

The opinions of Rav Huna and Rav Chisda on Daf 10 are both based on the fact that the upper Sukah constitutes a sufficiently high roof to invalidate the lower Sukah. So Tosfos articulates both their views in terms of \"Ohel\". The only difference between them is from where to learn the amount. Rav Huna learns 1 Tefach from *Tumas* Ohel, whereas Rav Chisda learns 4 Tefachim from Reshuyos of Shabbos. An objection to what I am saying might be this: Tosfos should have used the word Sukah instead of Ohel, since the Pesul on Daf 10 under discussion is \"Sukah under another Sukah\", and not \"Sukah under another Ohel\".

Why not mention there that it's a problem of maamad with something which is mekabel tumah? 2. The sevara over there of why Rava said it is good, is as Rashi says, because the schach which is kosher is mevatel the schach pasul. So why not here too, despite the fact that he was maamad with mekebal tumah, which Rashi says is only a problem of being as if he was using pasul schach, just say that the majority of the kosher schach is mevatel the pasul schach (the maamad)?\n",

Accordingly, we could resolve both your questions:\n",
      "1. The Gemara on Daf 15 doesn't mention the problem of Ma'amid because it doesn't exist according to those opinions.\n",
      "2. Here on Daf 21, because of the problem of Ma'amid, all of the Schach is Pasul, since it is held up by the bed. So Bitul is not available. But there, on Daf 15, since Ma'amid is not a problem, therefore most of the Schach is Kosher; accordingly, Bitul entitles us to validate the Sukah as a whole, despite the minority of Schach Pasul. \n",

      "Great question. Lavud doesn't apply to Tumas Ohel. We find this in the Mishnah (Ohalos 10:1-2), the Gemara (Sukah 18a), and in the Rambam (Tumas Meis Chapter 16). So in your case the Ohel will not spread that Tumah; rather it will go up straight through the open space, and the Ohel will not be Tamei.\n",

      "Shalom Tuvya,\n",
      "Great questions. \n",
      "\n",
      "I. Nature of the Tirdah\n",
      "You asked what the Tirdah is about. There are several interpretations. Here are a few:\n",
      "A. He is afraid he will not be proficient (Baki) in the act of intimacy [1,2]. \n",
      "B. He is afraid he will discover that she does not have Besulim [3,4,5]. \n",
      "C. He is afraid that his organ will become injured during the act of intimacy [6]. \n",
      "\n",
      "II. Second Wife\n",
      "You asked if Tirdah applies if she is his second wife. That would appear to depend on the various opinions. Reason B would apply, since the fact that she is his second wife doesn't assure him that she has Besulim. But reasons A and C might not apply. For instance, suppose his first wife was a Besulah. Then his Tirdah may no longer exist, for example if with his first wife he performed well (reason A) or suffered no injury (reason C).\n",
      "\n",
      "III. Only Besulah\n",
      "You asked if the Mitzvah only applies to a Besulah. Correct me if I am wrong, but I am going to assume you mean Tirdah plus Mitzvah. The Gemara says it applies to a Besulah but not an Almanah [7,8,9]. \n",
      "Moreover, let's imagine she was never previously intimate with anyone, yet lost her Besulim in some other way, e.g. via injury. If he knows that she has no Besulim, then arguably there would not be Tirdah: according to reason A, because being proficient is not as difficult when there is no Besulim [1,5]; according to reason B, because he is not expecting to find Besulim; and according to reason B, because there is not as much physical pressure on his organ when there is no Besulim. \n",
      "\n",
      "IV. The Mitzvah\n",
      "The Mitzvah is consummating the marriage, which is a discussion unto itself [10,11,12]. But it applies even to an Almanah. The reason he is not Patur when she is an Almanah is because the Mitzvah doesn't involve great Tirdah. \n",

      "Great to hear from you. I like your question. I see the Gemara in Berachos on Daf 24a clarifies that the Tefilin should not be placed directly under the head [1], and this would seem to be true even according to the opinion of Shmuel [2]. Once it is established that sleeping with one's head directly over the Tefilin is forbidden, perhaps we can better understand why Rashi cites the rationale that we are not angels [4]. Even though we are only human beings, and therefore during the course of sleep we might accidentally place our head upon the Tefilin, nevertheless Chazal did not oblige us worry about that possibility. This interpretation also would be reflected in the Ra'avad [3].\n",

      "Shalom Menachem,\n",
      "Very good question! I see the Acharonim speak about this point. Maybe we can organize it as follows. The Kashya makes three assumptions:\n",
      "1) Rashi means literally that there is no problem to fast on Yom Tov (or Chol ha'Moed as you astutely pointed out).\n",
      "2) There is a prohibition to fast on Yom Tov in the day and in the night.\n",
      "3) There are no exceptions to that prohibition.\n",
      "I am aware of three answers, each of which will erase one of those assumptions above.\n",
      "Answer A) Rashi's language is to be taken with a grain of salt. He does't mean that we are allowed to fast on Yom Tov per se. He is just saying that with regard to Hilchos Sukah, there is no obligation to eat. This is the Pnei Yehoshua's first answer. And it fits with Tosfos' understanding on Daf 49 of Berachos.\n",
      "B) Rashi can indeed be taken literally, and he is saying it is OK to fast on Yom Tov. Only that this is permitted specifically at night. The prohibition to fast is only in the daytime. This is the Pnei Yehoshua's second answer.\n",
      "C) There is a prohibition of fasting on Yom Tov, but there is an exception if you had a bad dream the night before (see Shabbos 11a). In such a case, fasting is OK according to the Chachamim, but not according to R. Eliezer. This is Aruch la'Ner's answer.\n",

      "That is a nice point! The Beur Halachah writes that the problem of being called a \"Hedyot\" is if he is remaining in the Sukah because he is trying to force the Master to accept his service, since that is a violation of Derech Eretz [1]. Accordingly, one would be entitled to stay if for example he is simply indifferent, e.g. doesn't have any better place to go. I hope that helps.\n",

      "\n",
      "My question is why in the wording of the bracha at weddings do we say v'Tzivanu Al ha'Arayos v'Asar Lanu Es ha'Arusos.... this seems to lump the arusot together with the prohibition on arayos which is de-oraita. maybe i'm reading to much into it, or it's like the bracha on chanukkah where we include divrei sofrim in \"vetzivanu\"?\n",

      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Dear Josh,\n",
      "Very interiesting question. \n",
      "Incidentally, the Rambam codifies the words a drop differently, \"separated us from Arayos\" [1]; as opposed to the formulation we find in our Gemara, \"commanded us concerning the Arayos\" [2]. The commentaries [3] explain the Rambam's version based on the Chazal's understanding of the Mitzvah \"to be holy\" [4], i.e. to keep away from Arayos [5]. Thus, according to the Rambam, you might still have your question, albeit with a slightly different nuance. \n",
      "Regarding what you said about Berachos including rabbinically enacted Mitzvos, I believe you are Michavein to Rashi's explanation, including the reference to Ner Chanukah [6]. Very sharp of you to point out that this Berachah includes both a reference to commands of both a Torah level and also a rabbinic level. Off hand I cannot think of another such example of a Berachah. \n",
      "Another important interpretation to be aware of, and according to which your question has a very smooth answer, would be that of the Raavad cited in Rashba [7] who says that the prohibition of Arus and Arusah is in fact Min HaTorah, not just Midrabanan.\n",

      "\n",
      "I had a few questions on the sugyas of Arel mentioned in Yevamos. There is a machlokes Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam about whether someone who remains uncircumcised because his brothers died still has the shem of \"arel\". Rashi seems to say that since the reality is he still has a foreskin, he's an Arel. RT says that becase there's no more chiyuv to circumcise he's no longer in the category of \"arel\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the questions\n",
      "1) Is the final halacha decided one way or the other?\n",
      "2) Is the argument any different wrt to a persons son's and slaves and eating the korban pesach and whether they're considered arel'im?\n",
      "3) Would rabbeinu tam allow someone who's brothers had died and thus wasn't circumcised to do the avodah in the beis hamikdash?\n",
      "4) Does the chiyuv kick in on the 8th day during day time only? Assume a healthy child, and the night of his 8th day falls out on erev pesach. Can the father not eat the korban bc the mitzvah is chal and his son isnt circumcised? Can we generalize anything here to other holidays....like can I eat my etrog on the first night of sukkot, or is it already a mitzvah object at that point even though i cant use it until morning?\n",
      "5) Aren't gentiles called \"arelim\"? Given they have no mitzvah at all to circumcise, is this support for the view that the status of arel is simply dependent on physical reality and not mitzvah status? Thank you.\n",

      "---------------------\n",
      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Dear Josh,\n",
      "Good questions!\n",
      "1) Most opinions follow Rashi, including the implication of the wording in the Rambam, as the Minchas Chinuch points out. \n",
      "2) Logically, R. Tam would allow a father (or master) to eat Korban Pesach if his son (or slave) was not circumcised because his older brothers died because of Milah. This would be a Kal va'Chomer, since R. Tam holds that even the uncircumcised person himself can partake, so he will not prevent someone else from partaking.\n",
      "3) From the perspective of R. Tam's precedent, i.e. the suggestion on Daf 71 that a baby before 8 days is not obligated in Milah at all, one would surmise that this is a general law that applies to all cases of Arel, in which case, yes, R. Tam would allow such a person to serve in the Mikdash.  \n",
      "4) Yes, I think we for instance from the Rambam that this only kicks in during the day, based on the relatively far reaching example he cites for how a son could be not obliged in Milah when the Korban Pesach was slaughtered on 14th Nisan and yet the son does become obliged before the father partakes of the Korban Pesach that night [3]. Regarding Esrog, that might be a more complex example. Since typically an item will assumes its status of Muktzah at the onset of Yom Tov, i.e. at nightfall; and in addition, at times an Esrog can be Muktzah Machmas Chisaron Kis. \n",
      "5) Recall that there is a difference between what people call Arel, and what has the Halachic status of Arel [2]. Incidentally, you may have seen the application of Milah to the \"gentile\" children of Keturah [1].\n",

This seems a very big chiddish!   1. @Meheiche teise that we should be worried about a new Bais Din coming up with a new shiur kezayis? If Beis Din paskens a certain shiur today, why should I think this may be wrong and a future Beis Din will have a different shiur?  2. If a future Beis Din finds a new shiur, will they be be able to override the shiur that has been defined by an earlier beis din?  3. Even if they have the power, will their psak be retroactive to be mechayev a maase done when the old psak was in force?  4. Doesn't this attitude of worrying a future beis din will find a new halocha cast aspersions on the current halocha chalila  and make the current halocha weaker in people's minds?\n",

      "Great questions. I understand that you are asking according to the Hava Amina, in which the future Beis Din will adopt a smaller size of k'Zayis, thus rendering the person Chayav. Because according to the Maskana, in which the future Beis Din will adopt a larger size of k'Zayis, that will render the person Patur.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It is possible for the future Beis Din to overrule the decision of a previous one [a]. Under some circumstances the latter Beis Din must be greater than the previous one [b]. One might object, since the Gemara later says that Shiurim are rulings from Moshe at Sinai [c], and Rambam writes that such rulings are not capable of being subject to dispute [d]. However, it seems that here the olive is remaining as the standard for the Shi'ur, and the dispute is just which size variety of olive.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sender Klein  asks:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Poskim learn from the sugya about Ikar Vidui that one must stand for Vidui (the Ran derives it and the Rosh seems to have that in the text of his Gemara).  This is difficult to understand based on Rashi on Daf 20 that Mishtachavim Revachim was on Yom Kippur in order that one not hear his friends Vidui.  So apparently Vidui was done on the ground.  Maybe there is a difference between the Vidui of tefilah and other Vidui, but I couldn't find any source suggesting such a distinction, and the Pri Megadim cited in the Mishnah Brurah doesn't sound that way, since he questions whether a person must repeat Vidui if he was sitting.  (Someone also pointed out to me that Vidui on a korban was done during smicha, which is done b'chol kocho, and also seems to go against this rule.)\n",

      "The Kollel replies: \n",
      "Dear Sender,\n",
      "Wow, very excellent questions!\n",
      "Let's first discuss your Kashya from Rashi [4]. I would suggest three possible solutions.\n",
      "First, recall that the Rambam actually does not rule that one must stand for confession [1]. The commentaries are bothered why not [2], since there appears to be clear proof from our Gemara, as you cited, according to the Rosh and Ran. \n",
      "The Avodas Hamelech [3] resolves this by suggesting an alternative interpretation of our Gemara. Chazal were establishing that the portion of Viduy for which Shmuel stood was the Ikar part of Viduy. The reason Shmuel stood was simply because that main Viduy had the status of Chazaras Hashatz, and Shmuel wanted to stand for Chazaras Hashatz. So, one possible way to reconcile Rashi would be to say that he, like the Rambam, follows the Avodas Hamelech's interpretation of the Gemara. Thus, standing is not necessary for Viduy.\n",
      "(By the way, you may have seen the Maharsha [5] on that Rashi, who contrasts the people who bow for confession with Kohen Gadol who stands for his confession.)\n",
      "A second possible solution would be to say that Rashi agrees one must stand for Viduy. But the reason for standing is to be humble [6]. If so, then it is equally acceptable to bow, because bowing also shows humility. (One might object, \"If so, then why did Shmuel stand instead of bow?\" To that I would offer a couple of reasons: Maybe he didn't have the energy [7]; maybe he felt it would be difficult Halachically [8].)\n",
      "A third approach, though it seems more speculative to me, would be this: Rashi agrees that one must stand for the *formal* Mitzvah of Viduy. But the Viduy that the Jewish people said whilst bowing in the Azarah was not their official obligation of confession; but rather it was a spontaneous expression of submission and closeness to G-d.\n",
      "Regarding your Kashya based on Semichah b'Kol Kocho, we should discriminate between the different opinions. According to Rambam (and Rashi according solution #1 above) we have no Kashya at all, since Viduy doesn't require standing. But according to the Rosh and Ran, we may suggest this resolution: leaning is only a problem when it detracts from or is extraneous to the Mitzvah, unlike Semichah on the Korban which is an integral part of the Teshuvah.\n",

      "\n",
      "shmuel  asks:\n",
      "\n",
      "where do we find last 3 brachos in the amida are praise of hashem? only 1 is (modim), the other 2 are requests?!\n",

      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "The Kollel replies: \n",
      "Dear Shmuel,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very powerful question.\n",
      "Rambam writes (Tefilah 1:4) that the last three Berachos are for thanksgiving, \"Hodayah\".\n",
      "The difficulty with that, as you correctly pointed out, is that only the second one, \"Modim\", seems to be about thanksgiving.\n",
      "I see in the Rambam Mevoar (Keren Talelei Berachah edition) two answers from the commentaries:\n",
      "1. \"Retzei\" and \"Sim Shalom\" are classified as Hodayah since they are requesting spiritual needs, not materialistic ones. This was cited from Abubraham, Seder Tefilos l'Chol, Sha'ar 2, Tikun ha'Tefilos v'Inyaneihem. I still don't fully understand, for two reasons: a) Just because a request is spiritual, why should it be classified as thanksgiving? b) some of the Berachos in the middle of Shemoneh Esrei also seem to be spiritual requests, e.g. Selach Lanu. \n",
      "2. Really the only Berachah of Hodayah is \"Modim\", but it deserves to be accompanied by two other Berachos, one before (\"Retzei\") and another after (\"Sim Shalom\"), similiar to what we find by Krias Shema which has Berachos placed before and after it. This is cited from Radvaz Responsa Volume 8, Siman #15. I still don't fully understand, though, because the Rambam's language would seem to indicate that all of the final three Berachos are Hodayah.\n",
      "I hope this helps somewhat.\n",

      "\n",
      "Greetings. All the psukim related to remembering the Torah that appear in the Torah and in Mishlei are metaphorical referring to keeping the Torah in one�s mind all the time � yadecha, zichron, oys, etc. etc. It is only in one case where specifically oys and totafos refer to tefillin. But even if we say that there is both the metaphorical meaning (according to Rashbam) in addition to the asmachta for tefillin, we cannot say that the tefillin correspond to wearing them all the time the way a person is supposed to remember the Torah all the time. In fact the Torah itself nowhere states the duration of wearing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do we need an asmachta in that posuk for tefillin when they are anyway halacha leMoshe miSinai in all their aspects, and given the fact that wearing them does not even correspond to the literal/metaphorical meaning of constantly keeping the Torah as a sign in ones actions and one�s thoughts?\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, �beyn eynecha� does not really exist, so what does this contribute except in a purely metaphorical way (the space between the eyes is maybe half an inch at most), especially since miSinai tefillin are worn at the top of the forehead, which has nothing to do with �between the eyes�?\n",
      "It would make more sense to connect tefillin with the head as �totafos al roshecha� as an asmachta.\n",

      "In Tanach (e.g. Devarim 14:1) the phrase \"between your eyes\" is not literal, but rather it means in the middle of the head, in the place where the hair grows [2,3,4].\n",
      "Interestingly, the commentaries discuss the idea about what allegories may [5] or may not [6] be interpreted in the Mitzvah of Tefilin.\n",

Two practical differences emerge from this: First, when the person violates the second oath did he do a sin? According to Rav Akiva Eiger yes; according Avnei Miluim no. Second, if the person would be released somehow from his first oath, does the second oath take effect. According to Rav Akiva Eiger yes; according Avnei Miluim no. \n",

Rather, he takes on double dose of Kedushah, which can take effect, and that translates to conducting two consecutive periods of Nezirus. \n",

      ">>The mishna says according to the chachamim \"ain ledavar kitzv\". Rashi goes further and says not only are no bread meals obligated, but if one wanted to fast he could. Rashi seems to contradict a Mechilta on Shmos 12:16 that darshans an obligation to honor the chol hamoed with clothes and food. Fasting would seem to violate this.\n",
      "Menachem Weiman, St. Louis, United States>Shalom Menachem,\n",
      "Very good question! I see the Acharonim speak about this point. Maybe we can organize it as follows. The Kashya makes three assumptions:\n",
      "1) Rashi means literally that there is no problem to fast on Yom Tov (or Chol ha'Moed as you astutely pointed out).\n",
      "2) There is a prohibition to fast on Yom Tov in the day and in the night.\n",
      "3) There are no exceptions to that prohibition.\n",
      "I am aware of three answers, each of which will erase one of those assumptions above.\n",
      "Answer A) Rashi's language is to be taken with a grain of salt. He does't mean that we are allowed to fast on Yom Tov per se. He is just saying that with regard to Hilchos Sukah, there is no obligation to eat. This is the Pnei Yehoshua's first answer. And it fits with Tosfos' understanding on Daf 49 of Berachos.\n",
      "B) Rashi can indeed be taken literally, and he is saying it is OK to fast on Yom Tov. Only that this is permitted specifically at night. The prohibition to fast is only in the daytime. This is the Pnei Yehoshua's second answer.\n",
      "C) There is a prohibition of fasting on Yom Tov, but there is an exception if you had a bad dream the night before (see Shabbos 11a). In such a case, fasting is OK according to the Chachamim, but not according to R. Eliezer. This is Aruch la'Ner's answer.\n",

      "Tosfos seems to be explaining that this case is an exception because Rebbe Yochanan/Rebbe Shimon Bar Yochai knew that the prohibition to recite a blessing over Chalah separated from stolen grain is indeed an application of the principle of Mitzvah ha'Ba'ah b'Aveirah (though one could question that), and that entitles us interpret the lesson from Malachi 1:13 to not offer a stolen Korban not as a unique stringency of Kodashim, but rather a general taint in any Mitzvah. \n",
      "(As you might already know, the Maharam offers an answer to the obvious follow up question, \"If so, then why didn't Rebbe Yochanan cite the verse about not blessing over Chalah?\")\n",
      "You may also be aware that there is a another opinion in the commentaries which does not extend Mitzvah ha'Ba'ah b'Aveirah to realms outside of Korbanos. The Netziv in Meromei Sadeh argues that this is the opinion of Rashi, and also that of the Chasam Sofer, and also cites the Ritva on Daf 9 who brings such a view. \n",

      "On amud bet the gemara assumes that removing the berries from the hadas would be a psik reishah for mitaken maneh to make a cheftzah for the mizvah, and so has to conclude that the person removing the berries already has a hadas. But we know from Shabbos 133 that if it is a psik reishah dilo nichah leih it is muttar, and since mitzvot lav leihanot nitnu, can't we argue that making a kosher hadas is not nicha leih and so should be muttar?\n",

      "The Kollel replies: \n",
      "Dear Mark,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very nice question! You are referring to two different principles:\n",
      "#1) Mitzvos were not given for pleasure\n",
      "#2) Psik Reisha de'Lo Nicha Lei\n",
      "Each of these is needed and applied in their own distinct context.\n",
      "Principle #1 tells us what the Torah excludes from prohibitions of pleasure.\n",
      "Principle #2 tells us what is a person's Kavanah. \n",
      "For example, let's say someone wants to fulfill a Mitzvah by using an item from which it is forbidden to benefit. So, principle #1 teaches us that the Torah doesn't include Kiyum Mitzvah in the prohibition of Hana'ah [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. This does not mean he isn't interested in the outcome.\n",
      "On the other hand, Davar She'eino Miskavein is permitted, unless it is a Psik Reisha because then it count as if you intended the result. But, if it's Lo Nicha Lei, i.e. you are not interested in the outcome, then it will be Mutar [10]. That is not related to deriving forbidden pleasure.\n",
      "So, in our case, if the person did not have another Hadas, we would not invoke princple #1 to say that he isn't interested in the outcome. He certainly is interested in the outcome. That is why the Gemara needed to say he has another Hadas.\n",

      "One is from the sefer Erchei Tanaim v'Amoraim (under the entry of Rebbe Yermiyah): This Rebbe Yermiyah was from the first generation of Amoraim who lived very close to Rebbe Shimon Bar Yochai.\n",
      "The second is from the commentary Maharatz Chayes (found in the back of many Gemaras) which he bases on a Yerushalmi: This Rebbe Yermiyah lived long after Rebbe Shimon Bar Yochai, and only heard this statement second hand, not directly.\n",

Because for that, we could rely on the Chazaka that the Talis was and still remains Kosher. Rather, we are just extra careful to check their Ksahrus, since he will be making a Berachah, and we don't want to make a blessing in vain [3]. \n",
      "According to this reason, it would follow that if a person will wear a Talis without making a Berachah, then he would not have to check the Tzitzis beforehand.\n",
      "One could argue that such an instance could occur when a person wears a Talis that belongs to the Tzibur. Even though some sources indicate that normally a person would make a Berachah on such a communal Talis [4].

      "\n",
      "Regarding the response about the size of the eggs, very recently they discovered a 1,000 year old egg in Israel, a 1,700 year old egg in England, and a basket of 2,500 year old eggs in China.\n",
      "From the pictures and rulers, they all look the same size, like a small or medium egg of today, about 6cm.\n",
      "I remember that in the introduction of a sefer from about 100 years ago, Rav Kook wrote that 8n Egypt they had found ancient eggs, which were the same size as the eggs in his time.\n",
      "I don't recall which sefer.\n",
      "So of course we all are happy to be machmir, but why doesn't this prove that the smaller shiur is in fact the correct one.\n",
      "Some now claim that the Grouch Noeh was wrong because of coins that were discovered which are smaller than the size and weight he had used in his estimation according to the Rambam\n",
      "There must also be some other explanation to answer the discrepancy found by the Tzlach and the Gra and the Chazon Ish and Rav Moshe, all of whom used the finger measuring method.\n",

      "The Kollel replies: \n",
      "\n",
      "Dear R’ Menachem,\n",
      "\n",
      "You make a great point. As you know, we would be most interested in what the *volume* of each egg was, since that is the relevant quantity, as it relates to Shiurim in Halachah. You might also know that Rav Yakov Gershon Weiss (author of Midos U'Mishkalos Shel Torah) also pointed out that eggs found in the pyramids of Egypt and eggs preserved by the ashes of Vesuvius are both about the same size as today’s eggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a general point on archaeology, some Rishonim did indeed rely on discovered artifacts as decisive evidence to settle certain disputes in Halachah. One notable example is that of the Ramban who writes (Shemos 30:13) that he came across an ancient coin, and based on its weight he ruled in favor of Rashi’s opinion regarding the size of a half Shekel. Granted, others were less trusting of the Ramban’s conclusion based on the coin. For instance, Abarbanel (ibid) was more skeptical, since coins can shrink over the years. That suspicion might be less relevant regarding eggs. \n",
      "\n",
      "In modern times opinions differ regarding how to treat archaeological evidence as it pertains to Halachah. The Chazon Ish (Collected Letters 2:22, 3:19) seemed unenthusiastic about relying on archaeological findings, since drawing conclusions from those findings might involve too much uncertainty. Rav Kook (Igros ha’Reiyah 423, 574, 91) also expressed skepticism about certain archaeologists' conclusions, but did welcome their attempt to glean insights from their findings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Potentially, one can reconcile the conclusion of Rav Chaim Na’eh with the size of our fingers by using a measure of the thumb’s width at a point closer to the tip of the thumb (2 cm) rather than at the widest part of the thumb (2.4 cm).\n",
      "\n",
      "For someone interested to learn more about this subject, I would encourage reading these articles where I found these insights about the subject: \n",

      "Shalom R' Samet,\n",
      "\n",
      "Very nice question. There may a number of reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, some Gaonim maintain that if the Jewish people will repent, then Mashiach Ben Yosef will not necessarily come [1]. Some suggest that this could be why the Rambam chooses not to mention the issue [2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, even if he will come, some commentators maintain that the process is not so clearly understood, so one cannot say too much about it [3]. It is possible that the Rambam felt there was no pressing reason to write about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the main reason Rambam describes Mashiach at all -- at least in Mishneh Torah -- is because it is a critical article of Jewish belief [4]. Rambam even recommends that one should not too deal too much with these issues [5]; if so, perhaps we should not be surprised to see the Rambam not delve into it.\n",

      "#1) No Manna would fall on Shabbos; and \n",
      "#2) They needed to eat meals on Shabbos. \n",
      "On Yom Kippur, consideration #1 indeed applies, since no Manna would fall on Yom Kippur [1].

Therefore, one might argue that no extra portion of Manna should be necessary on Erev Yom Kippur. \n",
      "On the other hand, there typically are people who need to eat on Yom Kippur for health reasons; and so an extra portion of Manna might be appropriate for those special cases. However, even that arguemnt is definitive, since those who needed to eat could alternatively partake of other available foods [3]. \n",
      "By the way, some commentaries even ask the question: If our Gemara considers eating Manna to be an affliction, then it should be permitted for anyone to eat it on Yom Kippur; however, others resolve this proof, by saying that the affliction was only referring to the hunger each day before the Manna fell [2].\n",

Though some question this, arguing that only half as much should be required [3]; some cite the Yerushalmi to this effect as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the payment, there is a Mishnah [4] which tells us where the funds came to pay for several items, two of which are referred to as \"Lashon\". The first Lashon is called the \"Lashon Shel Zehoris\". It is paid for from the donations to the Lishkah. The Rambam explains what that is [6]. The second Lashon is the one between the horns of the scapegoat. It is paid for from the remainders of the Lishkah, not the primary donations. \n",

      "The question arises, what is being referred to as the first Lashon? Some say it is the one thrown into the fire of the Parah Adumah [5]. Others say it is the one tied around the neck of the goat for Hashem [7]. You can find more written about it here [8].\n",

      "Your premise may be correct, and it is in fact better to feed her the permissible food rather than a forbidden one. But the scenario very possibly could be that only the forbidden food is readily available, whereas the permissible is too inconvenient to access. But if you can satisfiy her crave with Heter rather than with Isur, do that. This is reflected in Gemara and Rambam [1]. \n",

      "Good morning. I was wondering: In the way Rashi explains the preference/Machlokes of feeding the Mesukan either Tevvel or Terumah, i.e.: Terumah could be separated, and since at least MeDeOraysa one kernel is good enough for Terumah, why don't we for sure say to separate Terumah in a Pachos MeKeShiur amount; at most it is Osur MeDeOraysa, but not Onush Misa, as opposed to Tevvel!?\n",

      "Some commentaries suggest that we are dealing with Terumas Maaser, in which case there is indeed a minimal shiur that must be separated [1]. \n",
      "Others suggest that Terumah is a more serious problem because the separation would entail creating an actual forbidden entity [2]. \n",
      "Still others actually reject Rashi's approach in large part because of your Kashya, and instead explain that Rabah means that when you can separate the Tevel into Chulin and Terumah, then everyone agrees that is best, and the Machlokes Tanaim is only when there is no option of being Mafrish [3].\n",

      "Great to hear from you. Yes, in Shenos Eliyahu the Gra wants to explain the discrepancy between the plural \"Korin\" used for reciting Shema versus the singular \"Mevarech\" used (on Daf 11) for the Berachos of Shema. He maintains that it is a reflection of a Halachah that in a group all individuals must say the Shema for themselves (\"Korin\") versus the Berachos of Shema where one person can recite it (\"Mevarach\") on the other people's behalf. \n",
      "This resembles a Ritva (Megilah 2a s.v. Megilah) who makes a similar point regarding the singular \"Megilah Nikreis\", since Krias ha'Megilah can be done by one person for another unlike Shema.\n",
      "The Shaagas Aryeh (Siman 6 s.v. \"Mikol Makom Nireh\") actually disputes this point and believes that one person can say Krias Shema on someone else's behlaf. Mishnah Berurah (Siman 61 s.k. 40) comments that most Achronim agree to allow this, in other words not like the Ritva and Gra.\n",

      "Great to hear from you. Very excellent questions! \n",
      "1. Is there any greater purpose of bringing children rather than stones? \n",
      "a. Baruch she'Kivanta! Kli Yakar (Devarim 31:12) also grapples with this point. He maintains that bringing the Taf in particular assist the Teshuvah process for the adults. The adults beseech Hashem for mercy on behalf of the innocent young children who especially deserve mercy, since they have never sinned. \n",
      "b. Iyun Ya'akov (s.v. K'dei) indicates that even the very young children contribute to the gathering of ultimately a greater multitude of people, which shows more honor for Hashem (b'Rov Am).\n",
      "2. How is Shema Yisrael our \"Chativah\" to Hashem, if it is written by Hashem in the Torah?\n",
      "a. One might have understood in a simple way that this was Moshe's exortation to the Jewish people to accept the Yichud Hashem which they willingly accepted. The fact that Hashem chose to write these words of Moshe in the Torah does not necessarily detract from the fact that it is indeed a commitment and declaration that is fulfilled by the Jewish people, not only at that point in history, but also every time we recite Krias Shema. \n",
      "b. However, you are prestigious company with the Derashos ha'Ran (7 s.v. v'Ani) who raises an objection resembling yours; that is, since we are legally obliged to this commitment, it is therefore not right to consider it a \"Chativah\" from our own initiative. He therefore maintains that the Gemara refers to the sons of Ya'akov who recited Shema Yisrael to their great father before he passed away (based on Pesachim 56a).\n",

Possibly Beis Shamai is arguing with that principle in general, i.e. Korban Re'iyah only applies during a Regel per se.\n",

      "Can we try to understand the Gemara as follows?\n",
      "As you correctly pointed out, Beis Hillel's view is that a child need not come to Yerushalayim for Aliyah l'Regel if he is so young that cannot even manage to travel while holding his father's hand. \n",
      "Let's ask, though, what is the reason for that? \n",
      "Is it because of (a) the psychological fact that at this young age he has underdeveloped faculties? Or is it because of (b) the mere physical fact that he is unable to walk?\n",
      "If we assume the correct reason is (a), then there is no reason Beis Hillel should, for instance, exempt a child who is old enough to walk yet temporarily happens to be lame. \n",
      "But if look in the Mishnah (2a) and Rashi (s.v. Shalosh Regalim), we seem to see that the reason that Chazal are conveying is actually (b).\n",
      "If so, then we can better understand why it was obvious to Reish Lakish in the Gemara on Daf 6a that a child who cannot walk -- even for a reason other than age (namely, at the moment he is lame) -- does not have to come for Aliyah l'Regel.\n",
      "(It is only according to Beis Shammai that there is even a possibility for him to be obligated, since at the very least he is able to travel to Yerushalayim at least on his father's shoulders. But, as you know, even that relies on the assumption that Chinuch applies because he will eventually be able to walk again later; there exists the alternative Tzad that he could be Patur, the rationale being since even an adult who is temporarily lame is exempt.)\n",

      "2. Regarding the Tosefta's information, I would understand that you are referring to when Ben Zoma was looking between the upper and lower waters. I can share what I found about this issue.\n",
      "a. As you know, the Torah states (Bereishis 1:7) that the Rakia divides between the upper and lower waters. Ben Zoma appears to be describing its width and Rebbe Yehoshua objects. \n",
      "b. Maharsha cites a Machlokess about the identity and location of this Rakia. He says that Ramban and Rashi on Chumash maintain that it is the Galgalim. But the Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim maintains that it is the actually space of cloud formation. He points out which opinion this Gemara appears to support.\n",
      "c. Regarding the calculation of the width, a Perush in Ben Yehoyada says that the figure of 3 fingerbreadths can be calculated by subtracting the Gematriya of \"Elokim\" (86) from that of \"Mayim\" (90), with an additional subtraction of 1 because the hovering was \"*on the surface of* the water\". In other words, 90-86-1=3.\n",
      "d. Turei Even suggests that the amount of three fingerbreadths was just based on Svara and all that is learned from the Pesukim is that it was very close; or alternatively 3 fingerbreadths was known to be the standard distance a Yonah hovers over its children. \n",
      "e. Interestingly, though, Turei Even also writes that he doesn't know how one would attempt to determine the distance *between the upper and lower waters* from a Posuk which is talking about *the Ruach Elokim that was hovering over the surface of the water*. \n",
      "f. To me that sounds like a different angle than the Kashya which is asked by the Gemara itself later based on the first versus second days of creation.\n",

The first is the son of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai who received a blessing from Rabbi Yonasan Ben Asmai and Rabbi Yehudah. The second is where Rabbi Shimon, the son of Chalafta, received a blessing from Rav. You want to know why they gave different blessings. Please correct me if I missing something.\n",

      "I just wanted to add a couple of points that might be helpful to clarify this issue. But, again, please let me know if I am not addressing the point that was bothering you. \n",
      "1. Who was the Rabbi in the second story?\n",
      "a. Our Girsa says that it was Rav; but \n",
      "b. the Rashash and others bring what might be a more authoritative Girsa that says it was Rebbe Yehudah ha'Nasi.\n",
      "2. Why in the story of the first son was the blessing cast in a language of curse, unlike in the second story where the blessing was more explicit? (This was my best estimate of what was bothering you; and indeed the commentaries grapple with this point.) Here are a few interpretations:\n",
      "a. They used a language of curse in order to \"disguise\" the blessing so that it wouldn't be canceled by the acussing forces. See Arugas ha'Bosem (Matos) and Divrei Yoel (Emor).\n",
      "b. They used a language of curse in order that Rashbi should be the one to utter the blessing, instead of the two rabbis, since the two rabbis felt that Rashbi was more worthy and holy than they were. (See Pesach Einayim and Maris ha'Ayin.)\n",
      "c. (Related to the previous answer.) Really, the son did deserve some degree of pain and suffering, and the rabbis realized this. Therefore, they expressed themselves in a language of curse. This accomplished two things: \n",
      "i) It allowed the son's destined affliction of pain and suffering to take the mild form of hearing hurtful words, rather than a worse form.\n",
      "ii) It gave the opportunity for Rashbi to utter the blessing, which -- coming from him -- would have such great power that would cancel the effect of the pain and suffering which the son was otherwise destined to undergo. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this helps!\n",
      "Best wishes,\n",
      "Yishai Rasowsky>It seems it was my mistake.  I thought bar Yochai had sent one son, then another, to the same pair, Rabbis Yonason and Yehuda.  \n",
      " \n",
      "It changes the question, a bit, but I wonder still whether the intentions of Rebbi Yonasan ben Asmai and Rebbi Yehudah were represented in bar Yochai's explanation.  May I ask, had the story been such: that the scholars were abusive, and the Rav, in the end, had spared his son from mishap by their word?>Dear R' Levine,\n",
      "Yasher koach for the insight! Yes, I hear that possible way of reading it! I am just reflecting, though, on why the mainstream way to interpret the Gemara seems to be that their intention was positive all along. I would imagine the reason is because it is too difficult to fathom that two great sages would want to apply harmful words to an innocent person -- especially if they understood he was Rashbi's son asking for a blessing. But even if they didn't, it would seem too hard to justify why the two rabbis would want to inflict harm on someone, particularly when Rashbi himself describes them in a complimentary way as Anshei Tzurah.\n",

      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Dear R' Levine,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very excellent point! Your question -- if I understood you correctly -- is this: How can there be an obligation of the father to find a wife for his son if the verses in our Gemara indicate that she is selected by divine providence. I see what might be two legitimate options:\n",
      "1. Based on the Gemara's own question and answer, as follows. \n",
      "a. Shmuel had said that a man may perform Erusin on Chol ha'Moed lest a second man does so first. The Gemara objected to this, on the basis of another statement of Shmuel, namely, that a Bas Kol already pronounced whom the person would eventually marry. The assumption of this Kashya appears to be that once a person's match is predetermined, then first man can be sure that he -- and no one else -- will marry his destined spouse. \n",
      "b. The Gemara answered that by increasing one prayers it is in fact possible to alter the course of marital destiny, and thus a second man could potentially marry this lady first. \n",
      "c. Perhaps a similar answer can apply to your question as well. That is, the father must make an effort to match his child with an appropriate spouse, lest some other man pray excessively such that he succeeds in taking her first.\n",
      "2. Alternatively, Hashem might only make it *possible* for the couple to find each other provided they and their parents make an effort to find the right one; but if they don't even try, possibly Hashem will not send her directly to him. For example, Hashem enabled Eliezer to find Rivka; but it involved some effort (traveling, etc) to seek her out. \n",

      "The Gemara says Arba'ah Nichnesu la'Pardes.  Did they go together?  If not (and they went at separate times) how were they permitted to go and put themselves into a possible situation of Sakanah?  They would have seen (at least the third one) that there was no guarantee to come out unharmed since it was only Rabbi Akiva that came out that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naftoli Willner, Baltimore, United States\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Shalom R' Naftoli,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very excellent questions! \n",
      "1) Did they go together?  \n",
      "a. The Talmidim asked of questions to Ben Zoma at the end of 14b. There is a Machlokess amongst the Mefarshim whether these questions were asked while he was still in the Pardeis or only after he came back. \n",
      "b. According to the former, which some maintain was the opinion of Rashi, that potentially would count as being accompanied by someone else, instead of being alone.\n",
      "c. The alternative contention that they were each alone might be reflected in the Perush of the Sh'lah ha'Kadosh who says that the entry of these four individuals into the Pardeis was paralleled in the past by another four instances, namely that of Adam, Noach, Avraham, and the sons of Aharon. Since the latter four (five if you count Aharon's sons as two) were cerainly at separate time periods in history, one might therefore infer that the venture of each of the four Tanaim also occurred at different times. However, this is not conclusive, especially since these four Tanaim indeed lived at about the same period.\n",
      "d. We see that R. Akiva warned the others not to say \"water, water\" when approaching the pure marble stones. This could be interpreted to mean that they were all together as a group, and R. Akiva was guiding them as the senior member. However, it perhaps be interpreted to alternatively mean that after R. Akiva had gone through the journey successfully, he was advising the others how to proceed when they would eventually undertake the journey later on. \n",
      "2) How were they permitted to put themselves into possible Sakanah?\n",
      "a. It could be that the three other than R. Akiva were indeed not permitted; or, even if they were in fact permitted, still they were not recommended to undertake this journey, since it does involve serious risk. \n",
      "b. On the other hand, perhaps even the great risk involved could be justified, for instance if there are great gains to potentially be won. For example, Ben Ish Chai in Ben Yehoyada cites Rav Chayim Vital to say that the goal of these Tanaim was to learn how to rectify the sin of Adam.

      "The Kollel replies: \n",
      "Shalom R' Avrumi!\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very excellent question! \n",
      "To my mind, it seems that the straightforward reason is because such a kiss would depict a degree of intimacy with a woman, which would constitute a breach of modesty. But can we expand your question, and actually pose the issue as an apparent contradiction? Because we do find places in the Torah that discuss a male kissing a female. How would one distinguish these from the case of Miriam? I will consider the two cases that come to my mind:\n",
      "1) Ya'akov and Rachel (Bereishis 29:11)\n",
      "a. I believe the most basic way to distinguish this case from ours is by pointing out that Miriam was an adult whereas Rachel was very young.\n",
      "b. Some commentaries make the point that Ya'akov was not kissing her because of lust, but rather because of their familial relationship. See for instance Ha'amek Davar of the Netziv. I understand this to mean that because they were cousins they automatically had a familiar bond, and it was not based on desire. Netziv even writes that the very reason Ya'akov cried was in order to demonstrate this fact. Potentially such a demonstration would not be practical by Hashem with Miriam, and perhaps therefore the Torah chose to omit the kiss entirely.\n",
      "c. Some say Ya'akov's kiss was not on Rachel's lips (Rabeinu Bachye; cf. ha'Kesav v'ha'Kabalah who cites differing views). This was not so in the case of Miriam, as we can see from the scene Rashi depicts on b'Midbar 20:26. Perhaps that is a reason why the Torah omits it.\n",
      "d. Recanati writes that the kiss of Ya'akov to Rachel is reflective of the connection between Hashem and his Shechinas Uzo. I am not sure if that helps resolve our issue by enabling some Chiluk between that case and ours. Or, on the other had, maybe it strengthens the question since putting Hashem into the equation would appear to make the case more similar to that of Miriam. \n",
      "2) Shir ha'Shirim (1:2, 8:1)\n",
      "a. This context might be an exception since, as R. Akiva says in the Mishnah at the end of the third chapter of Maseches Yadaim, Shir ha'Shirim is Kodesh Kodashim. I see Meleches Shlomo explains this to mean that it's full of fear of heaven and acceptance of the yoke of Hashem's kingship. Possibly, this is a reason why graphic language is legitimate there but not in Miriam's case.\n",
      "b. In perhaps a related manner, we can recall that the commentaries understand this love song to be a parable. See for example Metzudas David on Posuk 1:1 who adopts the interpretation that the verses express the love between Hashem and the Jewish people. Possibly that could justify the explicit language of loving physical contact, which is not typically found in other portions of Tanach such as the case of Miriam. Though now I recall there are other passages that discuss it, e.g. Shoftim chapter 16, Shmuel II 13:14, and many others. Though maybe there it can be considered non-explicit language.\n",
      "c. The Netziv that we mentioned before actually marshals Posuk 8:1 as the example of familial love that is in fact legitimate to express even in public. I would understand that this is based on the reference to brotherly love which is made in the beginning of the Posuk itself. According to this, I am not sure how one can reconcile the case of Miriam, unless we say that the expression there is one of a more intimate love between Hashem and Miriam's soul. But in that case, I might still have a difficulty, since some commentaries explain Shir ha'Shirim as representing the relationship between Hashem and the soul. See for example Malbim in the Melitzah portion of his commentary. \n",
      "So although some points remain Tzarich Iyun I still hope this helps as a start!\n",

      "Yishai Rasowsky\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",
      "ADDITION:\n",
      "Arguably, a simpler and perhaps more compelling explanation could be this:\n",
      "The G'nai that Chazal are referring to is not just the mention of an intimate act with a woman, but also -- even more strikingly -- the impression that Hashem Himself -- perish the thought -- would or could be involved in a physical relationship with a human being. Considering such ideas could beget improper theological conceptions. \n",
      "Rashi on Chumash (b'Midbar 20:1) could be understood to support this explanation. Because he uses a different phraseology than what we find in the Gemara. Our Gemara said it would be a G'nai. Rashi says it would not be a Kavod for Hashem, thus emphasizing the divine aspect, rather than just a feminine Tzniyus aspect.\n",

See for example Metzudas David on Posuk 1:1 who adopts the interpretation that the verses express the love between Hashem and the Jewish people. Possibly that could justify the explicit language of loving physical contact, which is not typically found in other portions of Tanach such as the case of Miriam. Though now I recall there are other passages that discuss it, e.g. Shoftim chapter 16, Shmuel II 13:14, and many others. Though maybe there it can be considered non-explicit language.\n",
      "c. The Netziv that we mentioned before actually marshals Posuk 8:1 as the example of familial love that is in fact legitimate to express even in public. I would understand that this is based on the reference to brotherly love which is made in the beginning of the Posuk itself. According to this, I am not sure how one can reconcile the case of Miriam, unless we say that the expression there is one of a more intimate love between Hashem and Miriam's soul. But in that case, I might still have a difficulty, since some commentaries explain Shir ha'Shirim as representing the relationship between Hashem and the soul. See for example Malbim in the Melitzah portion of his commentary. \n",

      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Shalom Jacques,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very excellent questions! \n",
      "1. Even on the latter days of Sukkos, when the Mitzvah of Lulav is relatively weak (e.g. it does not apply on a Torah level outside the Mikdash), the Isur of Muktzeh was not enough to override the Mitzvah of Lulav; the Gemara had to come on to the Gzeirah of Rabah, i.e. lest a person carry 4 Amos etc. If so, then when the first day of Sukkos falls on Shabbos the Isur of Muktzeh will certainly not override the Mitzvah of Lulav, since on Tom Tov Rishon the Mitzvah of Lulav is stronger (e.g. it applies all over, according to the Torah, not just in the Mikdash). \n",
      "2. The Gemara's initial suggestion was that the Mitzvah on the first day only applies in the home, in which case there is no concern to carry. But according to the Gemara's conclusion, where we want to know what the Pshat could have been before that Takanah, logically the concern for a person to carry the Lulav would equally apply to the first day of Yom Tov; just, Chazal did not believe it was right to uproot the Mitzvah on that day, since it is a stronger level Chiyuv, as refleted by the fact that it is d'Oraisa even outside the Mikdash.\n",
      "3. The Gemara here concludes that the only reason we don't take the Lulav nowadays when Yom Tov Rishon falls on Shabbos is because of the Sfeika d'Yoma that resulted from delayed communication of Kidush ha'Chodesh. That rationale would apply at least to people Chutz l'Aretz whose Minhag is to observe two days of Yom Tov. But the Gemara on 44a tells us that in the Maskana this rule of not taking Lulav when Yom Tov falls on Shabbos applies even in Eretz Yisrael, and Rashi there explains it is because we don't want division between various parts of the Jewish people (\"Agudos Agudos\").\n",

Other Mitzvos which are spread out in the Torah and one Aseh has nothing to do with the Lo Taashe (like Mezora and Hakofas Rosh, the two commandment come from two different angels, one could understand maybe the concept of Aseh Doche.

He makes the point that when the Mitzvah cannot be done in any other way, then indeed Hashem is effectively telling us straight out to \"violate\" what would otherwise be a Lav; thus we would not infer a princple of Aseh Docheh Lo Ta'aseh. \n",
      "On the other hand, in a case like Tzitzis and Sha'atnez, even though they are written next to each other, since the Mitzvah could be done without violating the Lav, e.g. with a wool garment instead of a linen one, then it is actually a Chidush to say that the Mitzvah of Tzitzis should override the Lav of Sha'atnez.

      "\n",
      "Greetings again! \n",
      "\n",
      "I was very curious why it is that the mishnah in Kiddushin 80 about yichud does not even mention WHO or WHEN the takkana was established even according to R. Shimon, and that it was a comment of R. Yochanan/R. Yishmael that shed light on that based on a posuk (which itself is a bit hard to understand). If there was a scriptural basis for the takkana, why wasn't it mentioned in the mishnah, and indeed, WHY would we care about a scriptural source at all whenever a takkana is issued by the Sanhedrin, what difference does it make whether or not there was a scriptural basis??!\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, why do we care about the story itself of Amnon and Tamar either in Sanhedrin 21? Surely a Sanhedrin could justify a fence for whatever reason it wished, AND on the other hand, if it WERE based on the case of Amnon and Tamar, we surely wouldn't worry about a specific scriptural basis as mentioned in Kiddushin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it seems strange that it would have taken until Shammai and HIllel to include yichud with an idolatrous woman, since it would be a kal vachomer - if yichud is prevented with a kosher Jewish woman, then al pi kama vekama with an idolatrous woman. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure I understand really why there would be need for a prohibition of yichud with an UNMARRIED woman, since she is permitted  to a man anytime according to basic Talmudic law. Any concern about nidda would be a secondary issue having nothing directly to do with whether or not a woman is permitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "(I guess the bottom line in modern times would be its application in the world where, for example, concerns about security and safety require automated locking mechanisms and the sheer strangeness of having to be choshed on oneself as a kosher Jew.)\n",

      "\n",
      "Shalom R' Goldman,\n",
      "I appreciate seeing that you took effort to examine this Gemara from a number of angles. Yasher Ko'ach!\n",
      "Below I will try to contribute what I hope sheds some light onto your various points of investigation. If you see any gaps or flaws, please let the Kollel know, and someone will try to fill them in. \n",
      "I understand that you are talking about the Isur  Yichud of one man with two women. It sounds like you are assuming that it is a Takana d'Rabanan. That is the view found in Rashba Shu\"t I:587; a supporting Diyuk for this being that the Gemara provides a rationale of \"Daatan Kalos\" which would seem to be superfluous of it is a Din d'Oraisa. \n",
      "However, there are views who maintain that it is Min ha'Torah. See Shu\"t Maharsham III:153 DH v'Hinei.\n",
      "Regarding the citation of scriptural source, we routinely find the Mishnah omitting the source for various laws. Instead, such a discussion of the basis behind the Dinim in the Mishnah would typically be relegated to the Gemara. See Rashi in Bava Metzia Sof 33a DH Gemara.\n",
      "If this law is mid'Rabanan, then when I first considered your question about the significance of having a scriptural source, I suspected simply that the Posuk would confer a stronger legal power to the Din. But I did not see this exact nuance in Mefarshim. \n",
      "Instead, what I find is that the Ritva (Rosh Hashanah 16a DH v'Ha) believes that when there is an Asmachta to a Posuk for a Din d'Rabanan, then it actually means that Hashem Himself believes that this law should be observed, but just He didn't oblige us. Instead, it is Chazal job to take the initiative in making the Takanah. \n",
      "Seen in this way, having a scriptural basis for the Din gives it a stamp of divine approval, so to speak, reflecting Hakadosh Boruch Hu's endorsement of the specific law. \n",
      "Alternatively, we find in Kiryat Sefer (Hakdamah, section #4) that having a scriptural source is actually a critical part of what provide the license to Chazal to establish such a Takanah; meaning, without the Posuk, they wouldn't or couldn't have legislated this particular law.\n",
      "Regarding the need to extend the decree after the case of Amnon and Tamar, I think your logic is right; namely, ideally there should be no reason to decree against Yichud with a Penuyah, as you assumed. But after the story of Amnon and Tamar, Chazal saw that tragically it was necessary in order to prevent that sort of misconduct. \n",
      "Vis a vis the story of Amnon and Tamar being the impetus for the extension of the Yichud decree, a number of times we find that Chazal decide to enact a Takanah -- which they otherwise wouldn't have -- specfically because they saw from a certain incident that unfortunately there was a pressing need for it. For another case like this see for example Mishnah 1:10 in Beitzah.\n",
      "Finally, regarding the need to decree against Yichud with an idolatress, I see two views in the Mefarshim as to why it was not already included beforehand. The Ran (Kidushin 81a) maintains that it is because only Yichud with a Penuyah was common, versus Yichud with a Goya was not common; consequently Chazal didn't decide to include it in the prior decree. \n",
      "The Taz (Even ha'Ezer, Siman 22, Seif Katan 1), on the other hand, believes that the reason a Goya was excluded is because only a Penuyah could potentially involve an Isur d'Oraisa, i.e. when she is a Niddah; unlike a Goya, who mid'Oraisa has no Tumah as a Niddah. As you might know there is more about the successive extensions of the Yichud decree found in Avodah Zarah 36b.\n",

      "\n",
      ">>Greetings again! \n",
      "\n",
      "I was very curious why it is that the mishnah in Kiddushin 80 about yichud does not even mention WHO or WHEN the takkana was established even according to R. Shimon, and that it was a comment of R. Yochanan/R. Yishmael that shed light on that based on a posuk (which itself is a bit hard to understand). If there was a scriptural basis for the takkana, why wasn't it mentioned in the mishnah, and indeed, WHY would we care about a scriptural source at all whenever a takkana is issued by the Sanhedrin, what difference does it make whether or not there was a scriptural basis??!\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, why do we care about the story itself of Amnon and Tamar either in Sanhedrin 21? Surely a Sanhedrin could justify a fence for whatever reason it wished, AND on the other hand, if it WERE based on the case of Amnon and Tamar, we surely wouldn't worry about a specific scriptural basis as mentioned in Kiddushin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it seems strange that it would have taken until Shammai and HIllel to include yichud with an idolatrous woman, since it would be a kal vachomer - if yichud is prevented with a kosher Jewish woman, then al pi kama vekama with an idolatrous woman. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure I understand really why there would be need for a prohibition of yichud with an UNMARRIED woman, since she is permitted  to a man anytime according to basic Talmudic law. Any concern about nidda would be a secondary issue having nothing directly to do with whether or not a woman is permitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "(I guess the bottom line in modern times would be its application in the world where, for example, concerns about security and safety require automated locking mechanisms and the sheer strangeness of having to be choshed on oneself as a kosher Jew.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks,\n",
      "David Goldman>Shalom R' Goldman,\n",
      "I appreciate seeing that you took effort to examine this Gemara from a number of angles. Yasher Ko'ach!\n",
      "Below I will try to contribute what I hope sheds some light onto your various points of investigation. If you see any gaps or flaws, please let the Kollel know, and someone will try to fill them in. \n",
      "I understand that you are talking about the Isur  Yichud of one man with two women. It sounds like you are assuming that it is a Takana d'Rabanan. That is the view found in Rashba Shu\"t I:587; a supporting Diyuk for this being that the Gemara provides a rationale of \"Daatan Kalos\" which would seem to be superfluous of it is a Din d'Oraisa. \n",
      "However, there are views who maintain that it is Min ha'Torah. See Shu\"t Maharsham III:153 DH v'Hinei.\n",
      "Regarding the citation of scriptural source, we routinely find the Mishnah omitting the source for various laws. Instead, such a discussion of the basis behind the Dinim in the Mishnah would typically be relegated to the Gemara. See Rashi in Bava Metzia Sof 33a DH Gemara.\n",
      "If this law is mid'Rabanan, then when I first considered your question about the significance of having a scriptural source, I suspected simply that the Posuk would confer a stronger legal power to the Din. But I did not see this exact nuance in Mefarshim. \n",
      "Instead, what I find is that the Ritva (Rosh Hashanah 16a DH v'Ha) believes that when there is an Asmachta to a Posuk for a Din d'Rabanan, then it actually means that Hashem Himself believes that this law should be observed, but just He didn't oblige us. Instead, it is Chazal job to take the initiative in making the Takanah. \n",
      "Seen in this way, having a scriptural basis for the Din gives it a stamp of divine approval, so to speak, reflecting Hakadosh Boruch Hu's endorsement of the specific law. \n",
      "Alternatively, we find in Kiryat Sefer (Hakdamah, section #4) that having a scriptural source is actually a critical part of what provide the license to Chazal to establish such a Takanah; meaning, without the Posuk, they wouldn't or couldn't have legislated this particular law.\n",
      "Regarding the need to extend the decree after the case of Amnon and Tamar, I think your logic is right; namely, ideally there should be no reason to decree against Yichud with a Penuyah, as you assumed. But after the story of Amnon and Tamar, Chazal saw that tragically it was necessary in order to prevent that sort of misconduct. \n",
      "Vis a vis the story of Amnon and Tamar being the impetus for the extension of the Yichud decree, a number of times we find that Chazal decide to enact a Takanah -- which they otherwise wouldn't have -- specfically because they saw from a certain incident that unfortunately there was a pressing need for it. For another case like this see for example Mishnah 1:10 in Beitzah.\n",
      "Finally, regarding the need to decree against Yichud with an idolatress, I see two views in the Mefarshim as to why it was not already included beforehand. The Ran (Kidushin 81a) maintains that it is because only Yichud with a Penuyah was common, versus Yichud with a Goya was not common; consequently Chazal didn't decide to include it in the prior decree. \n",
      "The Taz (Even ha'Ezer, Siman 22, Seif Katan 1), on the other hand, believes that the reason a Goya was excluded is because only a Penuyah could potentially involve an Isur d'Oraisa, i.e. when she is a Niddah; unlike a Goya, who mid'Oraisa has no Tumah as a Niddah. As you might know there is more about the successive extensions of the Yichud decree found in Avodah Zarah 36b.\n",

He in fact suggests the follwoing thematic link between the statements of Rav Chana Bagdata. The term for an Almanah is a reference *to the future* Takanas Chazal. So too, suggests the Toras ha'Agadah, the subsequent explanations from Rav Chanan Bagdata are related to the future: Rain produces no immediate change in the soil, but still provides nutrients and vitality for the produce which will eventually grow later on. Likewise, the benefits conferred by dates last into the future, since their nutrients remain in the body for a long time. \n",

It is interesting that Tosfos does not draw this conclusion as a result of your excellent Kashya; but rather on different grounds, i.e. since the Rayah (beginning on the third line of 27a) must be only a case of Eishes *Kohen*, since the other family members distances themselves from her.\n",

      "Great to hear from you. The source to exempt a person from paying money and incurring lashes for is the Posuk in Devarim 25:2 which says lashes are given K'dei Rishaso. It teaches us that apart from the prescribed Malkos, there was no other punishment for the same sinful action, e.g. monetary payment. This apparently is regardless of whether there were two separate victims or not.\n",
      "This interpretation will become more clear later in Kesubos 37a. Still, it may also helpful to see where Chazal speak about this on other Dapim. For example, in Kesubos 32b (with Rashi Kesuvos Sof 31b DH v'Kayma Lan d'Ein Lokeh u'Mishalem), Yerushalmi Kesuvos 3:1, and also Makos 4b.\n",

So, it is the Shaliach who is Chayav Misah, whereas the thief is Chayav to pay the Dalet v'Hay for Tavach u'Machar.

      "\n",
      "Dr. Moshe Kaplan  asks:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Amoraim discuss what the pain of raping feels like. How did they know - did they ask women about it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Moshe Kaplan, Jerusalem, Israel\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Dr. Kaplan,\n",
      "a) I appreciate your question about this sensitive topic. Let's discuss this one step at a time, first with a general point, and then the specific issues raised in the Gemara. Whenever a victim is due payment for pain incurred, it is plausible that the particular pain is a sensation which most people have not experienced. For example, Chachamim teach us how to calculate the Tza'ar which is due to a victim whose arm was amputated. We must estimate how much a person who must undergo amputation by sword would pay to instead undergo the amputation by drug (Bava Kama 85a; Rambam, Chovel u'Mazik 2:10). This notwithstanding the fact that people -- besides those who have experienced it -- wouldn't know what it feels like first hand.\n",
      "b) More relevant to our case, as you asked, we would need to examine each of the sensations of pain that is involved, and then determine how the Amoraim were familiar with it. Take, for instance, the Hasharas Besulim which is part of the Biah Rishonah. A man would not know first hand what it feels like, but Tosfos (39a DH Tza'ar) reports that young women actually became unwell as a result of this painful process. Men could surely know about this second hand, based on the experience of their own family and community members.\n",
      "c) In a case of Tefusah specifically, the Gemara initially considers the Chabatah Al Gabei Karka. This abuse would be expected based on known past cases; moreover, the sensation of the pain itself is more commonly known, since falling -- or, perhaps more correctly, being thrown down -- to the ground is an experience whose pain would be acknowledged and understood by virtually anyone.\n",
      "d) The later suggestion in the Gemara is the pain of Pisuk Raglayim. That indeed, as you observed, is something about which men would not have direct knowledge. The Ritva makes the point that this is the reason that the Gemara cites and relies on the Posuk from Yechezkel 16:25, in order to inform us about the pain involved in Pisuk Raglayim.\n",
      "e) The later issue of what the Pikchos report about what seduced women feel -- or, perhaps more correctly, do *not* feel -- is actually subject to controversy. Some say it is the Hasharas Besulim (see Tosfos ha'Rosh). Others say that it is the Pisuk Raglayim (see Shitah Mekubetzes citing the Ra'ah).\n",
      "f) Regarding the sensation discussed in the final stage of the Gemara (starting from the 11th line) -- whatever it refers to (that depends on the Machlokess above) -- the Chachamim indeed heard about it from women who were close to them, whether it be Abaye from his nanny, or Rav and Rav Papa from their wives. \n",

      "Regarding the Mishnah which says that they build a wall, one might understand that -- as the Mishnah's language actually suggests -- to refer to a place where people have the custom to build walls, not cheap blockades. And one can sympathize with such a Minhag, particularly if there will be inclement weather which a cheap blockade might not withstand, but a sturdy wall would. \n",
      "Regarding eavesdropping, one might possibly argue that unless the wall is very tall, then sound isn't totally blocked if there open space overhead. \n",

      "I am trying to clarify the machlokes amongst R' Shimon, R' Yehuda and R' Nechemia.  First I thought that R' Shimon holds once something has a use, it's not muktzeh, whereas R' Yehuda splits things into categories based on who uses them - things meant for people are not allowed to be used for animals (33a the case before the mishna, where we would assume a goose is meant for human consumption and thus may not be fed to a cat), and the reverse (the first mishna in the perek, where the pile of straw stored up for animal feed may not be used for burning).  R' Nechemia further requires that each thing be used for its main use only, as in the case of the knife for cutting a rope on 32a.\n",
      "Then I came across the statement that wood is only for burning on 33a, and R' Shimon permits it for other purposes.  The basic reading of Rashi seems to me to put  this statement within R' Yehuda's view, but I don't see how this fits with what I wrote above.

      "Great to hear from you. Very nice questions!\n",
      "1. Recall that Rebbi Shimon does not subscribe to the Isur Muktzeh (except if two conditions are met: #1 The item is not fit to use; and #2 the person has intentionally put the item away. For example see the references in Gemara [1] and Halachah [2].) \n",
      "Rebbi Yehudah, on the other hand, does subscribes to the Isur Muktzeh in a number of circumstances. \n",
      "Rashi explains [3] that since wood is only for burning, therefore it becomes Muktzeh for other usages as well. As such, only Rebbi Yehudah would forbid those other usages, whereas Rebbi Shimon would permit, as we find the Gemara states and Rashi explains [4].\n",
      "There is a question that the Rashba asks here, which may possibly be bothering you; that is, once it is permissible to move the wood for the purpose of burning, it should consequently be permissible to move it for other purposes as well. Rashba answers, as he writes, b'Dochak, that this would only be true if even after you use the wood as a support it could be used for burning, which is not true since then the supported item would burn up or fall over. \n",
      "Please let me know if some point remains unclear. \n",
      "2. I hate to make a Tircha for you, but please would be able to submit another question for this on the corresponding Daf? (I actually just glanced at Sukah 30b and got the impression that it may be a different source.) It may help us to keep the filing straight. Thank you!\n",

      "I see that in Maseches Sukkah, the Ran has a discussion [1] about the obligation to eat bread on the first night of Sukos that seems to shed light on the excellent point you raised. \n",
      "He first expresses one approach, that hypothetically from the laws of Yom Tov alone, we would only be obliged to eat a k'Beitzah of bread, which could actually be eaten outside the Sukah; but once the Torah teaches us -- via a Gzerah Shavah 15-15 -- that just as we must eat on the first night of Chag ha'Matzos, so too we must eat on the first night of Sukos, consequently that Achilah must constitute the size which requires a Sukah, i.e. more than k'Beitzah. \n",
      "Subsequently, the Ran brings another view, that the equation between the amounts one must eat on the first nights of Pesach and Sukos is quantitatively absolute, and so one need only eat a k'Zayis (which reflects the ruling of the Rambam [2]) Now, on any other day of Sukos could be eaten outside the Sukah. But, since the Gzerah Shavah establishes the first night as a firm obligation, therefore it is considered Keva and consequenty must be eaten inside the Sukah.\n",
      "Evidently, then, according to both views, the Mitzvah to eat because of Yom Tov does not oblige us because of \"Keva\" to eat in a Sukkah. But after the firm obligation we learn from the Gzerah Shavah, there is a Machlokess: The first view says even then obligation to eat in the Sukkah is still connected with the standard Shiur of Keva, i.e. more than a k'Beitzah. But according to the second view, the Gzerah Shavah is enough to make it Keva as reuire a Sukkah. \n",
      "However, Rav Akiva Eiger cites [3] opinions, including the Tzelach's interpretation of Tosfos [4], who express the same sharp line of reasoning that you did, that eating on Shabbos and Yom Tov is Keva and therefore requires a Sukah. Baruch Shekivanta!\n",

      "Great to hear from you. Very nice question! \n",
      "There are four main opinions in the Rishonim, mostly found in the commentaries to Gitin 36.\n",
      "1. Ramban: Shemitah nowadays applies on the Torah level. He bases this ruling on the majority view of the Chachamim.\n",
      "2. Most Rishonim (see Rashba, Ritva, Ran): Shemitah nowadays applies only on the Rabbinic level. This is based on the view of Rebbi, who maintains that the laws of Shemitah only apply when the laws of Yovel apply. Yovel only applies when all or most of the Jewish people live in Israel [1]. \n",
      "(See Rashi and Tosfos who dispute how the Drashah of Rebbi operates, and also whether or not the laws of Yovel applied during Second Temple).\n",
      "3. Baal ha'Maor (see Sefer ha'Terumah): Shemitah does not apply nowadays at all, except as a Midas Chasidus. The Raavad once held this view but later retracted from it. In Shulchan Aruch, after the Mechaber rules that Shemitas Kesafim is Rabbinic today, the Rema cites this view as a Limud Zechus for why many communities had not observed Shemitas Kesafim.\n",
      "4. Rambam: Shemitas *Kesafim* is only Rabbinic nowadays. Opinions differ whether Rambam also believes that Shemitas *Karka* today is a Torah obligation (Kesef Mishnah learns this way) or only Rabbinic (see the other commentaries on the Rambam). \n",

      "Rav Chaim Kohen (from the Baalei ha'Tosfos): Theoretically, there is a Mitzvah to live in Israel; but -- practically -- it does not apply nowadays, since it is so difficult to properly fulfill all the Mitzvos that apply in Israel [9]. I believe the Knesses Hagedola (Klallei Haposkim 16) follows this view. \n",
      "Rambam (12th century): It is permissible to live anywhere except Egypt [1]. One should rather live amongst idolaters in Israel rather than Jews in the Diaspora [2].\n",
      "Ramban (13th century): There is even a Mitzvas Aseh to live in Israel [3]. One reading the Ramban (see [10]) would get the impression that it is an obligation like Tefillin.\n",
      "ACHARONIM:\n",
      "Megilas Esther (16th century Italy [8]): Today there is no Mitzvah to live in Israel [4].\n",
      "Pa'as ha'Shulchan (circa 1800): Brings other authorities who agree with Ramban that it is a Mitzvah [5]. \n",
      "Eim ha'Banim Semeichah (passed away 1945): In modern times, with the tremendous need and effort to rebuild the Jewish homeland, even the Rambam would agree there is a Mitzvah to live in Israel [6].\n",
      "Satmar Rav (passed away 1979): In modern times (post World War II) even the Ramban would agree there is no Mitzvah to live in Israel [7]. His view is largely based on \"the three oaths\" in Maseches Kesubos.\n",

      "Dear Menachem,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Yes, I recall our discussion regarding your sharp Kashyas about a few points related to this Daf: Ein Safeik Motsi mi'Yedei Vadai; statistics as they relate to Paskening Sfeikos; and what makes a Sfeik Sfeika different than one Safeik.\n",
      "For the question you asked now, I am using as a reference the excellent Sefer of Rav Achikam Keshet [1] who discusses this and many other topics. I hope you find it to be as insightful a resource as I have.\n",
      "1. What type of Chazakah d'me'Ikara does this Bayis have? \n",
      "The two types, as you correctly listed (though I might use slightly different terminology), are A) Chezkas ha'Guf and B) Chezkas ha'Din. Type A would include cases which involved a potential change in the physical facts, e.g. whether a Besulah was Nivala, or whether a woman saw blood. Type A would include cases which involve no change in the physical facts but only a change in Halachic status, e.g. whether a woman was married, or whether an animal is permitted to eat. Accordingly, our case appears to clearly be the first type, since the question involves whether Chametz was brought into the house.\n",
      "2. How does the Chazakah overtake a Safek?\n",
      "I am a little concerned that I didn't understand your intended question here, because this is the general rule regarding Sfeikos, i.e. they can be resolved by Chazakah d'mei'Ikara, as Chazal learn in Chulin 10 from the law of Negaim on a house [2].\n",

      "\n",
      "It's again the Pashtus of Chumas to say that Melech Arad was Sichon, because it clearly mentions Sichon in Parshas Chukas, and the battle that was in Yohatz. \"Achrei Hakoso es Sichon\" was not fulfilled until then. So even if you say Melech Arad was Sichon, the pashtus of pesukim says it was later in Yohatz when they fought Sichon, which was before the last \"Stansia\" in the Midbar. And Aharon was niftar earlier on Hor HaHor.  \n",

      "Great to hear from you. Very nice question! \n",
      "I see the Maharsha [1] tries to address the identity of Sichon in way that I hope helps clarify your issue. Though maybe it is not necessary for me to quote him at length. Either way, according to his explanation, the Gemara flows like this (step #4 being the most relevant, I believe):\n",
      "1. Makshan: How do you know that Aharon's death in Av occurred prior to Moshe's rebuke in Shevat? Maybe Moshe's rebuke in Shevat occurred prior to Aharon's death in Av!\n",
      "2. Tartzan: Moshe's rebuke was after Sichon's death; whereas upon Aharon's death Sichon was still alive, which is proven from the statement that the Canaani Melech Arad heard that Aharon died.\n",
      "3. Makshan: How can you prove from Canaan anything about Sichon? We know they are two different people. Because in Niddah 61a Chazal say that Sichon was a son of Achiyah son of the angel Shamchazai who descended to earth in the times of Enosh. And if so, he was not from Canaan! So, maybe when Aharon passed away, Canaani was alive and Sichon was dead! \n",
      "4. Tartzan: No, Sichon was indeed alive at the time Aharon passed away. Because Sichon, Arad, and Canaan are all the same person. And we know this because the real Melech Arad was one of the 31 kings of Canaan who was not defeated until much later during the conquest of Yehoshua. So when the verse in Bamidbar 21:1 discusses the battle waged with \"Arad\" during Moshe's time, it must be referring to Sichon who defeated by Moshe in the initial stage of conquest (i.e. before we entered Israel).\n",

      "But it seems that once the Gemara presents the explanation of Rava, then we understand that both opinions indeed agree on the fact that most animals have given birth before the end of Av. The dispute is just how to interpret the Torah's equation of animal tithes to grain tithes. Rebbi Meir says the following: The tithing year for grain ends right after the grain is \"finished\"; this is the first of Tishrei, since the grain sits out drying in the sun all summer including Elul, until it is brought indoors in the beginning of Tishrei. So too, for animals the tithing year ends right after they are \"finished\"; this is the first of Elul since the mother cattle give birth in Av. Rebbi Elazar and Rebbi Shimon, however, understand the equation more rigidly, and they say simply that just as the tithing year restarts in Tishrei, so too the tithing year for produce restarts in Tishrei.\n",

      "Shalom aleichem.  Is there no verse to contradict that R' Yehuda's stance that the shmita year counts as both the 50th and 1st of the following cycle is likewise applicable to the Sabbath: that the seventh day of creation is intended to count as the first of the new week?\n",

      "Dear R' Levine,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. I never thought about that question before! \n",
      "There seem to be a number of verses [1-7] to indicate that there are six days of labor followed by a seventh day of rest. If I correctly understood your application of Rebbi Yehudah's counting scheme, one could argue that it is difficult to justify Shabbos being day #1 of the following week. Since then there would only be five days of work, not six. This is not the case with Yovel, however, since the Torah just says to count 49 years [8] and the 50th should be sanctified as Yovel [9]. So there is no contradiction in saying that the subsequent set of 49 years begins with year #50 of the previous set. And even when the Torah says you will work the land for six years [10], that will be true for the six final 7 year cycles, just not the first one since we may not work the land on Yovel. \n",

      "1)  Earlier the Gemara discussed whether a day in a year is like a year, or a month in a year is like a year.  Based on that the Gemara set up the rules of Tosefes Kedusha for shvi'is.  Why do these things connect?  Maybe Tosefes Shvi'is is just a little bit of time and need not be considered like a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Why doesn't the Gemara try to extend Tosefes to Shvi'is according to the one who learns from Yom Kippur - why do we try to extend it to Shabbos and Yom Tov and stop there, when the whole purpose of the Sugya was to teach tosefes shvi'is.\n",

      "\ta. R. Tam: In order for the year before Shemittah to count as the first of three Orlah years [1].\n",
      "\tb. Ramban: If after the sapling plant took root thirty days did not pass, then one must uproot the tree, less three years from now, when the fruit becomes permissible, people will count backwards and think erroneously that this tree was planted during Shemittah [2].\n",
      "2) I see two explanations how the Gemara would -- or would not -- extend Tosefes to Shvi'is:\n",
      "\ta. R. Tam: Our Gemara is seeking the source on the basis of which Tosefes applies after the year if Shemittah [3]. This is expressed in the words of the Gemara \"every place the Torah says rest\" [5].\n",
      "\tb. Tosfos: Our Gemara was actually never searching for the source to apply Tosefes to Shemittah (because that we already learn in Moed Katan [6]); rather, our Gemara was searching only for the source to forbid Tosefes Shabbos and Yom Tov [4].\n",

      "\n",
      "Yishai Rasowsky  asks:\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand from the Rema [1] that it is wrong for a person to remain in the Sukkah when it is raining. He may as well go into his comfortable house! But what about other environmental disturbances? For example, mosquitoes, or gusty wind, or intense heat. If a person is willing to tough it out and eat/sleep in the Sukkah despite these climactic challenges, is he doing something meritorious, or is he just a Hedyot? I am specifically wondering about the last example of heat. Maybe it is better just to go inside and eat/sleep in the air conditioned house. Is there an objective way to gauge the level of this discomfort? It seems like each person might have their own personal barometer of what suffering they are able to withstand.\n",

      "\n",
      "1) Initially, eating from the Etz ha'Chayim would have afforded Adam eternal life even if he were to subsequently eat from the Etz ha'Da'as (ibid., DH Ela Yesh Lomar).\n",
      "\n",
      "2) If Adam were to eat from the Etz ha'Chayim after having eaten from the Etz ha'Da'as, that would actually remove the death sentence; it is for this reason that Hashem withheld the Etz ha'Chayim from Adam after Adam ate from the Etz ha'Da'as (ibid., DH v'Im Timtzi Lomar).\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Merely refraining from eating from the Etz ha'Da'as would not have been enough to achieve eternal life; Adam would need to eat from the Etz ha'Chayim, which provides continued life to both those who eat from it after having partaken from the Etz ha'Da'as and those who eat from it without ever having partaken from the Etz ha'Da'as. Hashem did not forbid Adam to eat from the Etz ha'Chayim before Adam ate from the Etz ha'Da'as, but He did forbid him from doing so afterward. The reason for this was the following: So long as Adam had not eaten from the Etz ha'Da'as, he was viewed as innocent and any sins would be at worst Shogeg; therefore, Hashem wouldn't mind if Adam carries on living a basically righteous life indefinitely. Once Adam ate from the Etz ha'Da'as, however, he then became susceptible to sinning even b'Mezid; therefore, Hashem decided it would be better for Adam's lifespan to terminate rather than continue living indefinitely on a path involving excessive sin (DH Davar Acher Adam Hursheh).\n",

      "1. We know that the \"Kedushah Sheniyah\" of the Olei Bavel covered significantly less territory than that of the earlier \"Kedushah Rishonah\" of the Olei Mitzrayim. The reason for that was, as our Gemara (Chulin 7a) says, because the Jews of that time wanted to set aside tracts of land from which people poor would be able to earn an income; therefore, places such as Beis Shaan were excluded from being sanctified with the Kedushah Sheniyah. However, I don't understand this to mean that every place which was not endowed with the Kedushah Rishonah was necessarily excluded from the Kedushah Sheniyah. For example, some places -- e.g. potentially in the region you mentioned -- might not ever have been conquered before Galus bavel; yet they could have been conquered at the Shivas Tzion in the time of Ezra. This would render them eligible to be endowed with the Kedushah Sheniyah, even if they never had the Kedushah Rishonah. \n",
      "2. As you might know, the *Kedushah* of Eretz Yisrael, with regard to Mitzvos ha'Teluyos ba'Aretz, is not dependent on being *part* of Eretz Yisrael. For example, Azah is *part* of Eretz Yisrael, as we see based on the statement of Rebbi Asi in Shabbos 145b. Yet, at the same time, Azah is not considered to be endowed with the *Kedushah* of Eretz Yisrael, as we see in the beginning of Gitin, where Ashkelon (which is farther north than Azah) is considered to be south of the sanctified portion of Eretz Yisrael.\n",
      "3. Just to add another dimension to the problem of identifying what is, or is not, part of Eretz Yisrael, some believe that the Mitzvah of living in Eretz Yisrael only applies to those places which have the Mitzvos ha'Teluyos ba'Aretz. This is the view of Tosfos in the first Daf of Gitin. The Ritva there argues and instead maintains that one issue is not dependent on the other; rather, there is a Mitzvah to live even in those parts of Eretz Yisrael which do not have Mitzvos ha'Teluyos b'Aretz. (Some say that the Gemara in the end of the first chapter of Sotah about the reason for Moshe's desire to enter Eretz Yisrael seems to imply like the view of Tosfos.)\n",

      "ADDITION:\n",
      "Shalom!\n",
      "I spoke about your excellent question with Rav Chaim Ackerman, and he kindly helped clarified a few points for me about which I was mistaken.\n",
      "First, as we know, the basis of the Kedushah Rishonah was the *conquest* achieved by the Olei Mitzrayim (Rambam, Hilchos Beis ha'Bechirah 6:16). This itself, however, does not entail actually killing or even driving out the inhabitants. In other words, even though there is a Mitzvah to destroy the Canaanite nations (Rambam Hilchos Melachim 5:4 and Sefer ha'Mitzvos #187, based on Devarim 20:17), nevertheless even the Kibush achieved by forcing a Canaanite city into submission (to pay tribute etc.) sufficed to constitute \"Kibush\" for the purposes of Kedushah Rishonah.\n",
      "Secondly, there were in fact no areas that the Olei Bavel settled that were not previously conquered by the Olei Mitzrayim. Interestingly enough, some commentaries even explain the Rambam to mean that since there was no Kibush in the times of Ezra (since we were under the dominion of Persia), therefore the Kedushah Sheniyah was only able to resinstate the Kedushah Rishonah that was originally imbued by virtue of Kibush (see Chidushei ha'Grach Al ha'Shas, b'Din Yeish Kinyan l'Akum v'Din Suryah b'Kibush Sheni, page 135, DH v'Hinei b'Yerushalmi Shevi'is).\n",

      "Shalom R' Gray,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Excellent question! The commentaries have a number of approaches to resolve this apparent contradiction. Here are a few that I came across:\n",
      "1. On 52b there is a problem because the relatives of Rebbi Yochanan went to arrange the fixed-price deal with the doctor without the consent of the widow; doing so against her will makes it a problem for Rebbi Yochanan to provide them this advice. On 54b, however, there is no problem, since no one is forcing onto the wife the arrangement to the designated land; the wife can decide of her own volition whether to accept the agreement or not (Tosfos 54b DH d'Niyached).\n",
      "2. Besides the above consideration, one can interpret that in the case on 54b the relatives are only trying to prevent the wife from *overindulging*, but not from partaking of her fair share of sustenance; therefore, it would not be wrong for Rebbi Yochanan to provide them this advice (Ritva 54b DH d'Niyached).\n",
      "3. Rebbi Yochanan actually regretted having given the advice in both stories. The story on 54b happened first, and the story on 52b happened second. When Rebbi expressed his remorse it was regarding his actions in both incidents (Rashi cited in Shitah Mekubetzes).\n",

      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Shalom R' David,\n",
      "First, we know from Tamid 6:3 that the Kohen who offered the incense would bow down. However, this is not a blessing addressed to the people per se; though it certainly constitutes divine service on their behalf, which is meant to turn Hashem's favor onto the population. \n",
      "But secondly, and more directly relevant to your excellent question, is that Tamid 7:2 records that the ensemble of Kohanim -- which included the one who had offered the incense -- would indeed recite a blessing the people. The blessing was comprised of the three verses from Bamidbar 6:24-26. As the Mishnah and commentaries clarify, the Kohanim would recite this three part series as one long continuum, not pausing for the people to answer Amen in between the verses.\n",
      "However, all that is on a regular day, when any ordinary Kohen might offer the incense in the Heichal. But on Yom Kippur, when the Kohen Gadol offers the incense in the Kodesh ha'Kodashim, the Mishnah in Yoma 5:1 records that he recites a brief prayer after exiting the Kodesh ha'Kodashim.\n",
      "The Gemara in Yoma 53b tells us that this prayer was that if the coming year is supposed to be hot, then it should be rainy. This could potentially be the best fit to what you described, since this prayer would provide blessing to the whole population.\n",

Are they responsible for any of their actions? Is their level of neshama any different to a gadol's and lastly: whats the Torah view on children that murder (this being a huge moral dillema for the non-jewish world in recent times)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tzvi B, England\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Shalom R' Tzvi,\n",
      "1) The Mishnah says that if a child injures someone's body (\"Chovel\"), then he is not obliged to pay. Logically, this exemption would apply also in the case of *property damage* (\"Mazik\"). \n",
      "2) As the Rambam writes (Chovel u'Mazik 4:20), the reason is, as you cited, because a child lacks Da'as. Others qualify the interpretation of this Mishnah on the basis of the fact that a child can make a Neder before Bar Mitzvah, which suggests that they *do* indeed have understanding, and nevertheless l'Maaseh the child is not punishable (see Temurah 2b), and therefore doesn't need to pay.\n",
      "3) The Rambam in Perush ha'Mishnayos (8:4 D.H. Cheireish) writes that even though he doesn't have to pay, still the Dayanim should discipline the Katan so that he should not inflict damage to people. This may be construed to mean that the child does have free will which, as a practical matter of societal functioning, has to be tempered and controlled. On the other hand, one could doubt this proof, because even animals, which have no free will, need to trained and disciplined so as not to cause damage.\n",
      "4) You asked if children are responsible for any of their actions. This would seem to be connected to more than one Machlokess Rishonim. \n",
      "a. First, does the child have to pay when he grows up? Some maintain that he does have to pay (Ohr Zarua Bava Kama 346, based on Bava Kama 98b -- see Rashi's explanation there; Hagahos Asheri Siman 9). This would indicate that children are responsible for their actions, just they don't have to deliver compensation until after their Bar/Bas-Mitzvah. \n",
      "b. Notably, however, most Mefarshim and Poskim disagree with this Pshat, and actually exempt the child even after reaching adulthood (See Rav Akiva Eiger I 147 D.H. Nireh). (The Meiri (here) even explains this on the basis of the fact that the child was Ohness at the time. Mefarshim question this reasoning, however, because the Ramban (Bava Kama 27b) holds that someone must pay even if he damaged whilst Ohness. Others suggest, on the contrary, that this premise of Ramban may be the understanding of the view (Ohr Zarua, Hagahos Asheri) which is Mechayev.)\n",
      "c. However, it is important to know that the Mishnah Berurah 343:9 rules that when the child grows up he should go beyond the letter of the law and indeed pay for being Choveil or Mazik (based on Taz, Chayei Adam, and seemingly Gra). \n",
      "5) Additionally, there is a Machlokess whether the Mitzvah of Chinuch to train children in Mitzvos rests upon the parent (Rashi Berachos 20a D.H. Ketanim) or upon the child himself (Tosfos Berachos 20a D.H. u'Ketanim and Megilah 19b D.H. v'Rebbi Yehudah). At least the latter view would seem to clearly hold that the child does bear responsibility.\n",
      "6) Regarding the level of Neshamah of a child versus a adult, indeed the Shulchan Aruch ha'Rav writes (Mahadurah Basra #2) that only part of the child's holy soul is imparted to him or her before reaching adulthood, whereas the main and complete portion of that holy soul is endowed to them upon Bar/Bas-Mitzvah.\n",
      "7) Regarding the dangerous and very serious issue of children that murder, G-d forbid, that would seem to fit under the Rambam's guideline about societal control mentioned above.\n",

      "Shalom Avrumi,\n",
      "Yes, I see two different possibilities to address your excellent question:\n",
      "First is Tosfos (DH Leima), who writes that the Gemara is not trying to prove *both* for Shmuel *and* against Rav Yosef. Rather, the Gemara means to prove *either* for Shmuel *or* against Rav Yosef. In other words, if I can express in a different way what you already articulately wrote, one could hold like Rav Yosef, but then in light of the Mishnah one *must* hold like Shmuel. (The other alternative, of course -- though it is less relevant to your question -- is that one can disagree with Shmuel, but then in light of the Mishnah one could not hold like Rav Yosef.) In other sources, by the way, this Perush is identified as being from the Ree.\n",
      "Second is Rabeinu Meir, which can be found in the Tosfos Rabeinu Peretz (and reportedly also in the Tosfos ha'Rosh, which I do not have on hand). He argues with Tosfos and maintains that the Gemara is indeed proving *both* for Shmuel *and* against Rav Yosef, because it can be shown (from Megilah 18b and Yeavmos 50a) that Rav Yosef disagrees with Shmuel. \n",

Meaning why does he need a migu bichlal to be believed to say that he built it? Let him use shah harbeh to taina I built it?

      "The wall, when it originally stood, was in the shared property midway between the spaces of the two yards [1]. So one party could *not* have been Zocheh in the wall stones with a claim that he built/bought them. The reason being, since they are not in his uncontested property. \n",
      "This is to be contrasted with the position of the stones after the wall's collapse, i.e. in the yard belonging to *only one* of the parties. Thus, without the Mishnah teaching us that they must split the stones after the wall fell, the Hava Amina would be to believe the one in whose yard the stones are lying if he were to say that he built it.

      "\n",
      "Tosfos says that if the kosel fell in one person's reshus, he has a migu to be believed to say I built it because he can taina I bought it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And why is he believd to say he bought it? Because he has a raya of shah harbeh.\n",
      "\n",
      "My question is like this. Tosfos says when the wall is standing (before it fell in one person's reshus), it's a case of drara d'mamona and there is a psak yachlokoo. I am assuming that psak yachlokoo is m'toras safeik, not m'toras vadai. So then why can't shah harbeh change the psak of yachlokoo? Meaning why does he need a migu bichlal to be believed to say that he built it? Let him use shah harbeh to taina I built it? And the raya of shah harbeh is strong enough to go against the psak yachlokoo as the psak was m'toras safeik, not m'toras vadai.\n",

      "Dear R' Menachem,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. \n",
      "You are quite correct that the Pask of Yachloku would be based on Safek, as we might see reflected in the lanuage of Tosfos [0].\n",
      "Very nice question! Could we understand it in the following way?\n",
      "The wall, when it originally stood, was in the shared property midway between the spaces of the two yards [1]. So one party could *not* have been Zocheh in the wall stones with a claim that he built/bought them. The reason being, since they are not in his uncontested property. \n",
      "This is to be contrasted with the position of the stones after the wall's collapse, i.e. in the yard belonging to *only one* of the parties. Thus, without the Mishnah teaching us that they must split the stones after the wall fell, the Hava Amina would be to believe the one in whose yard the stones are lying if he were to say that he built it. Since he could have claimed he bought and thereby won, because they were in his *exclusive* yard for a very long time [3]. \n",

      "First let me mention briefly three approaches on how to distinguish between practical Kabalah versus Kishuf, followed below by more background and details for research.\n",
      "Three ways to distinguish:\n",
      "#1. The two actions are the same, but the only difference is in the intent of the practicioner, i.e. Kedushah versus Tamei.\n",
      "#2. The two actions are indeed different: Kishuf is going against Hashem's laws of natural order, whereas practical Kabalah is working within the framework of the system that Hashem put in place.\n",
      "#3. Kishuf is forbidden since it is an action taken by the practicioner, whereas practical Kabalah is not an action at all, but rather a Tzaddik's Tefilah to Hashem to perform the particular action.\n",
      "Background and details for research:\n",
      "Indeed the Shelah [1] cites a \"Kovetz Yashan\" that says Yosef's brothers did this using Sefer Yetzirah. If so, it might help if we refer to the commentaries on the Gemara (Sanhedrin 67b) which records that R. Chanina and R. Oshaya also would use means of Yetzirah to create calves. \n",
      "Rashi there writes that *unlike Kishuf practicioners*, these sages did not create the calf directly. Rather they combined letters Hashem’s name and as a result Hashem made the calf. (Maharsha comments that to the naked eye it does look like Kishuf, and the difference lies only in the means of production, as per Rashi.) This resonates with approaches #1 and #3 above.\n",
      "See also Shach (Yoreh Deah 179:18) and Levush (Y.D. 179:15) who elaborate that this may be done only by people with pure and holy intentions. Nowadays, it is strongly discouraged since we are not as worthy as our ancestors. This reflects approach #1.\n",

      "ADDITION:\n",
      "Shalom R' Tzvi,\n",
      "I hope you are well. I just wanted to add what might be some more helpful sources to provide insight on your question. \n",
      "I. RESULT VERSUS ACTION:\n",
      "In addition to the Rashi we discussed above, two other sources that lend weight to the a Heter based on the fact that practical Kabalah is not your personal action, but rather only a result that follows: \n",
      " A. Yad Ramah (Sanhedrin 60b s.v. Amar)\n",
      " B. Shach (Yoreh Deah 179, s.k. 20 citing earlier Poskim)\n",
      "II. MALACHEI CHABALAH:\n",
      "A number of Mefarshim say that Kishuf is Davka when the at is done through damaging angels (which would differentiate it from Sefer Yetzirah):\n",
      " A. Ramban (Shemos 7:11)\n",
      " B. Rivash (Shu\"t 92)\n",
      " C. Rashi (cited in Rashba Shu\"t Meyuchas l'Ramban 283 and Rashba Shu\"t 1:413)\n",
      " D. See also Sefer ha'Chinuch (Mitzvah #62)\n",
      "III. PURE INTENT OF THE PRACTICIONER:\n",
      " A. The Levush cited in our previous exchange emphasizes that Hashem did allow the holy avenue of practical Kabalah, but only to be excuted with holiness and purity.\n",
      " B. The Shach cited in our previous exchange (who cited the Levush) emphasizes that even then it should only be done for the purpose of a great Mitzvah.\n",
      "IV. WITHIN THE NATURAL ORDER\n",
      " A. One might *possibly* argue that a ruling of the Meiri (in the same Perek of Sanhedrin) bears relevance here. He maintains that producing a living creature by natural means is permissible and is not outlawed by the prohibition of Kishuf. Still, logically one could maintain that there is room to differentiate between scientific natural activity which he permits versus the divinely endowed actions of Sefer Yetzirah.\n",

      "I have several difficulties understanding the Gemara's explanation of the Mishna that the Chagiga is like a mountain hanging by a hair:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Why do we need a pasuk to explain the pshat of a word? I thought it was obvious that Chagigah meant sacrifice. If we question the pshat of every word, I would think that every Mitzvah in the Torah would need the Oral Tradition and all of them would be 'hanging by a hair'.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Furthermore, there are many pesukim brought, all of which seem to indicate that Chagiga means sacrifice. The Gemara suggests that these extra verses merely imply additional prohibitions on leaving over a sacrifice until dawn, but that seems very strained (does this kind of added prohibition occur elsewhere?).\n",

      "Daniel Kagan, Haifa, Israel, UK\n",
      "----------------------------------------------\n",
      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Dear Daniel,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very nice questions! \n",
      "1. Literally Chagigah means \"celebrate\". True, we know that the word often refers to the Shalmei Chagigah, a Korban that is offered on the festivals, which are a time of celebration. But in a sense that can be understood as a borrowed usage of the term. This is similar to the term Reiayon [1]; literally it means \"see\", but it often refers to the Olas Reiyah, another Korban that is associated with the Yom Tov obligation to be seen in the Mikdash. \n",
      "2. In terms of Pshat, it would seem that the Gemara is trying to highlight the fact that despite the suggestive Pesukim which plausibly could be interpreted as referring to the term Chag/Chagigah Korban, nevertheless since they are not 100% ironclad as unambiguous, therefore the laws of Chagigah are still considered to be mountains hanging by a thread of hair. \n",
      "(I am not sure by what you mean to ask regarding whether this kind of added prohibition exists elsewhere. Momentarily I thought you meant to ask if the prohibition of leaving over until the morning applies to other Korbanos. But I do not suspect that is what you mean, because the Gemara seems to have addressed that openly [2].)\n",

      "There are four main opinions in the Rishonim, mostly found in the commentaries to Gitin 36.\n",
      "1. Ramban: Shemitah nowadays applies on the Torah level. He bases this ruling on the majority view of the Chachamim.\n",
      "2. Most Rishonim (see Rashba, Ritva, Ran): Shemitah nowadays applies only on the Rabbinic level. This is based on the view of Rebbi, who maintains that the laws of Shemitah only apply when the laws of Yovel apply. Yovel only applies when all or most of the Jewish people live in Israel [1]. \n",
      "(See Rashi and Tosfos who dispute how the Drashah of Rebbi operates, and also whether or not the laws of Yovel applied during Second Temple).\n",
      "3. Baal ha'Maor (see Sefer ha'Terumah): Shemitah does not apply nowadays at all, except as a Midas Chasidus. The Raavad once held this view but later retracted from it. In Shulchan Aruch, after the Mechaber rules that Shemitas Kesafim is Rabbinic today, the Rema cites this view as a Limud Zechus for why many communities had not observed Shemitas Kesafim.\n",
      "4. Rambam: Shemitas *Kesafim* is only Rabbinic nowadays. Opinions differ whether Rambam also believes that Shemitas *Karka* today is a Torah obligation (Kesef Mishnah learns this way) or only Rabbinic (see the other commentaries on the Rambam). \n",

When these opinions say it's a mitzvah (like the pas hashulchan) are they saying it's mamesh a chiyav like tefillin or just a keyim mitzvah?  Are there any achronim who say be-farish it is a obligation that a person has to do or do they use the ambiguous loshon of mitzvah (which would leave room to say they agree with Rav Moshe and hold its \"only\" a kiyum mitzvah and not a obligation)?>Dear A K,\n",
      "You are welcome. I know you asked for Acharonim, but at the moment to me perhaps the most striking language is from the Ramban who writes that each individual is obliged [1]. To our limited understanding, this would seem difficult to reoncile with Rav Moshe ZT\"L's interpretation [2] that it is not a Chiyuv but only a Kiyum if one does it. Granted, however, the proof that Rav Moshe brings is based on the Rambam who does not write that it is forbidden to live in Chutz l'Aretz.\n",

      ">>I know there i the well kown teshuva of Rav Moshe Feintein who says to live in Eretz Yiroel is only a kiyum mitvah and not a chiyuv.  Are there any achronim/poskim/other seforim that argue on Rav Moshe and say that living in Irael is a obligation like wearing tefillin?\n",
      "A K, Jerusalem>Dear A K,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very nice question! I came across the following views.\n",
      "RISHONIM:\n",
      "Rav Chaim Kohen (from the Baalei ha'Tosfos): Theoretically, there is a Mitzvah to live in Israel; but -- practically -- it does not apply nowadays, since it is so difficult to properly fulfill all the Mitzvos that apply in Israel [9]. I believe the Knesses Hagedola (Klallei Haposkim 16) follows this view. \n",
      "Rambam (12th century): It is permissible to live anywhere except Egypt [1]. One should rather live amongst idolaters in Israel rather than Jews in the Diaspora [2].\n",
      "Ramban (13th century): There is even a Mitzvas Aseh to live in Israel [3]. One reading the Ramban (see [10]) would get the impression that it is an obligation like Tefillin.\n",
      "ACHARONIM:\n",
      "Megilas Esther (16th century Italy [8]): Today there is no Mitzvah to live in Israel [4].\n",
      "Pa'as ha'Shulchan (circa 1800): Brings other authorities who agree with Ramban that it is a Mitzvah [5]. \n",
      "Eim ha'Banim Semeichah (passed away 1945): In modern times, with the tremendous need and effort to rebuild the Jewish homeland, even the Rambam would agree there is a Mitzvah to live in Israel [6].\n",
      "Satmar Rav (passed away 1979): In modern times (post World War II) even the Ramban would agree there is no Mitzvah to live in Israel [7]. His view is largely based on \"the three oaths\" in Maseches Kesubos.\n",

      "You are welcome. I know you asked for Acharonim, but at the moment to me perhaps the most striking language is from the Ramban who writes that each individual is obliged [1]. To our limited understanding, this would seem difficult to reoncile with Rav Moshe ZT\"L's interpretation [2] that it is not a Chiyuv but only a Kiyum if one does it. Granted, however, the proof that Rav Moshe brings is based on the Rambam who does not write that it is forbidden to live in Chutz l'Aretz.\n",

      "The passage of the Gemara which you cite is actually the Rayah that the Ran adduces to prove his Yesod. He observes that [even though Shevuah is in some ways more stringent than a Neder, e.g. it can be Chal on a Davar she'Ein Bo Mamash (e.g. sleep) and also it is \"not cleansed\" of punishment, nevertheless in another application a Neder has more ability to be Chal than does a Shevuah, for example on a Mitzvah. The Ran is Masbir that the principle behind that is because a Neder is an Isur Cheftza [and Gavra] whereas a Shevuah is [only] an Isur Gavra. For this very reason, says the Ran, a Neder can apply on top of a Shevuah, but not vice versa.\n",

Because, as you astutely pointed out, the house itself isn't changing, but rather the only difference is whether Chametz is present or not. I called Rav Keshet to discuss your point, however, and he felt that it seems to be Chezkas ha'Guf. The reason being because at its root the Safek does depend on the physical Metzius of whether there is Chametz present inside the house. Sfeikos of the other type, Chezkas ha'Din, however, depend on no physical Metzius, only Halachic status. \n",

      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Sure! Nice to hear from you again, Binyomin Zev. \n",
      "After checking more into this, I understand differently. \n",
      "The Yerushalmi here [1] indicates that one could indeed see Bavel from Beis Biltan even though it was very distant to the degree that they looked like little thorns (or some Girsaos say like grasshoppers). \n",
      "Moreover, the Aruch la'Ner [2] points out that although when viewing from Beis Biltin, one would not see the whole vast expanse of Bavel as a blazing fire, nevertheless one could see Pumbedisa in this way.\n",
      "From these sources, then, it seems we from Pumbedisa one could see Beis Biltin, notwithstanding your excellent point regarding the large distance from Eretz Yisrael to Fallujah. \n",
      "I also see another Sefer raises your question, which might help you further [3].\n",
      "Thanks for the reference to Ya'avetz! I understand -- as you also might -- that he was bothered how the Gemara can say that Bavel is not too far from Eretz Yisrael, whereas the Navi says it is far; so he answers that the Gemara is referring the whole state, parts of which are close to Israel; versus the Navi who was referring only to the city of Bavel, i.e. Baghdad, which is farther. However, we still might find the whole issue difficult since Fallujah is only ~50 km closer to Israel than Baghdad is.\n",
      "I hope this helps somewhat. Still your question calls for serious study!\n",

      "In the sefer kovetz halachos shabbas chelek 1, the rav brings from rav shmuel that a divorcee should continue the number of candles she was lighting for the number of children she has. I was not clear ,for example in the case of where she had 3 children so she was lighting 5 candles does she continue lighting 5 or can she light 4 candles because she no longer has her husband. Meaning is the first 2 candles shamor vezachor and the rest are for the children or the first two are husband and wife and now the woman would light only 4. If it is like the second way would she need to do haters nedarim to light 4 now?\n",

      "I would understand the first way, i.e that she remains lighting the same number of total candles, and does not subtract any, even though she no longer has a husband. The reason this seems clear to me is because even a woman who was never married also lights two candles. So, as you pointed out, the first two candles are for Zachor and Shamor, and the remaining ones are for her number of children (the basis for which I saw an interesting note for in the link below [1] in case you are interested to check it out).\n",

      "Shalom Mark, \n",
      "Moadim l'Simchah!\n",
      "I. Background\n",
      "1) In Beitzah 21b, Rebbi Yehoshua Ben Levi issues two rulings. \n",
      "a. His first ruling is that inviting a Goy is permitted on Shabbos. \n",
      "b. You can see, however, in Orach Chayim 325 that this could still raise potential concerns about causing the Goy to carry out items from your home. \n",
      "2) His second ruling is that inviting a Goy is forbidden on Yom Tov. \n",
      "a. This, the Gemara reports, is a Rabbinic decree based on the concern that the Jewish host will cook additional food for the non-Jewish guest on Yom Tov. \n",
      "b. Interestingly enough, the Rashba points out that even if one were to actually cook the additional food, this would only be forbidden Min ha'Torah if it is cooked in a separate pot and it is comprised of forbidden foods that one could not serve to a Jewish guest.\n",
      "II. Halachah\n",
      "1) On one hand, this prohibition seems rather debilitating if a Jew wants to host Goyim for Yom Tov. For example, the Mishnah Berurah 512:3 emphasizes that the prohibition exists even in a case where all the food was prepared beforehand. \n",
      "2) On the other hand, there are several mitigating factors, and in many cases it will actually be permitted. Here are some:\n",
      "a. When Yom Tov falls on Shabbos, like we have this year for the first day -- and, in Chutz l'Aretz, the eighth day -- of Pesach. This case would be Mutar, because one may not cook on Shabbos in any case, so it falls under the Heter of Rebbi Yehoshua Ben Levi's first ruling.\n",
      "b. The prohibition only applies if you *invite* the Goy (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 512:1). But if he eats by you without being invited, then there is no prohibition. For example: (i) the Goy is your servant, rather than a guest whom you dignify with an invitation, and hence he eats from our family's meal since he is part of the household staff; (ii) the Goy simply shows up to your meal based on his own volition (for more about this, see Mishnah Berurah 512:10).\n",
      "c. If rather than inviting the Goy to eat by you, you instead send a food package to him, then it's OK, because you are not likely to cook for him, since you are not hosting him on your premises (Rema ibid.).\n",

      "Normal when a man Marries a woman, only the 2 of them are affected. He is ossur to her relatives and she is osur to his relatives (after divorce).\n",
      "But by yibum, one of the brothers does chalitza,  and all the other brothers become erva to the tzoros and none of them might ever know about this. You might have 2 brothers on opposite sides of the world, one does chalitza (which makes the others into an issur kores acc. To resh lokish on 10b, or an issur lav acc to reb yochonon) and the other brother, unwittingly, performs yibum on another wife.\n",

      "Shalom R' Hersh,\n",
      "I like your thinking. Since my suggestions below do not definitively to resolve your point, so let me ask if someone else from the Kollel can reply with greater insight. I will just share two points that might help: \n",
      "1) Your situation reminds me of Oso v'Es Bno\n",
      "a. There are cases in which one person's action -- namely, slaughtering an animal -- can indeed create an Isur somewhere else, i.e. to slaughter that animal's parent/child; this would potentially apply even to people far away unbeknownst to them. \n",
      "b. In that case, however, if it is a likely scenario, then there is a requirement for the merchant to inform the person who purchases the second animal (Chulin 83a).\n",
      "2) Halachah tells us that it is the oldest brother surviving who is preferred to perform Yibum or Chalitzah (Yevamos 24a; Rambam Hilchos Yibum v'Chalitzah 2:6).\n",
      "a. Therefore, one gets the impression that usually there will -- and should -- be communication and coordination between the brothers before any one of them takes initiative to perform Yibum/Chalitzah. \n",
      "b. However, at the same time, there may be weaknesses in my reasoning, since it is also true that *if* a younger brother does in fact go ahead and perform Yibum/Chalitzah, then his action takes effect (Yevamos ibid.).\n",
      "c. Moreover, there are circumstances in which one brother is overseas and we in fact do not wait for him to return (Yevamos 39a; Rambam ibid. 2:9). That gives the impression, especially in an area before instant communication, that the far off doesn't know about the death or Yibum/Chalitzah procedure.\n",

      "Excellent question! As I see from the helpful reference in Mesivta, the Mefarshim grapple with this point, why the our Gemara does not suggest that it is Rebbi Yosi.\n",
      "Ritva suggests that it is because not all opinions hold that Rebbi Yosi agrees in the case of Isur Kolel (link 1 below). Interestingly, Keren Orah actually proves from our Gemara like the view of the Rashba that ultimately Rebbi Yosi does not agree in the case of Isur Kolel.\n",
      "Alternatively, Rashash answers that even if Rebbi Yosi does agree by Isur Kolel, the Gemara didn't want to choose his view, because Rebbi Yosi didn't say so explicitly, but rather it was only inferred.\n",

      "1. Tiferes Yaakov understands that he was planning to redeem them, as opposed to simply helping them to flee. This would avert the prohibition of the Mishnah to which you astutely called attention.\n",
      "2. Maharsha, however, indicates that his plan was to help them escape by running away. In light of the difficulty you raised, this view could possibly be reconciled based on the Yosef Lekach (Yevamos 79a) who suggests that just as there is a Heter for oneself to runaway, so too there may be permission to help one's relatives to escape; accordingly, if we would assume that these women were relatives of Rav Ilish, consequently there would be no prohibition.\n",
      "3. Possibly, if the situation was one in which there was a threat of death, then this would be subject to the dispute between Tosfos who waives the law of our Mishnah in such a case, versus the Ramban who doesn't.\n",

When, on the other hand, it is done in the context of a formal *wedding ceremony*, even if there are many people there, people do treat it with more respect and Tzniyus.

      "Dear Michoel,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Both very excellent questions! \n",
      "1a. Arguably, one might not think to limit this law to Chatas, because -- from the Torah Ohr at least -- I see that the verse being cited is referring to a different Korban type, namely Olah. \n",
      "1b. But to expand on this, Tosfos (Bava Basra 48a. s.v. Yakriv) teaches that this law applies specifically to *voluntary* Korbanos, i.e. Neder or Nedavah; but *not* for obligatory Korbanos, such as Chatas and Asham, since there is no need for coercion, since it is assumed that a person will bring these obligations based on their own initiative. The precedent for this qualification is in the Mishnah (Bava Kama 40a) which says that Beis Din doesn't force a person in such a case because presumably the individual will want the atonement. \n",
      "1c. However, this raises a question, namely, that if the Korban referred to here is only voluntary, then what is the reference to Kaparah? It is referring to proactive avoidance of the potential sin that would result had he not brought the Korban Neder/Nedavah.\n",
      "2. Rashbam (Bava Basra 48a) explains that this is based on the verse (Devarim 24:3) \"He shall give [the divorce document] into [his wife's] hand\", which implies that he must give it willingly.\n",

We know that Rav Papa's comment is addressing only the days of Chol ha'Moed, but not Yom Tov Acharon; whereas Abaye's comment addresses not only Chol ha'Moed but also Yom Tov Acharon. Therefore, the Gemara felt it was most appropriate to insert Rav Papa's comment after the Baraisa's ruling for Chol ha'Moed, before the ruling for Yom Tov Acharon; versus Abaye's comment which is best inserted after the Baraisa's ruling concerning Yom Tov Acharon, since Abaye will discusses that also.\n",

That would be the Pashtus, and it's OK for Pesach and Shavuos; but what about Shavuos, which has no Chol ha'Moed? We know that the people would remain the night after the Yom Tov until the following morning. So that next morning could be when the execution is held. Abaye *possibly* held that this is true for not only Shavuos, but the other Yomim Tovim as well. \n",

Just as they are exceptions to the rule of Inuy ha'Din, i.e. delaying their execution (until the Regel), so too the execution of their death sentence might be an exception to the rule of overriding Chol ha'Moed, not necessarily to be extrapolated to the general cases of execution referred to in the Baraisa.\n",

Albeit a seeming double standard, we do find that in some cases, e.g. conviction by majority by of two votes instead of just one. If so, the second question can be resolved also, since the Posuk only discusses a case of conviction, so it is only there that we would know they cannot combine; for exoneration, on the other hand, they might indeed combine.\n",

Therefore, it would not be justified to say Arayos Yochiach (i.e. Arayos apply to both genders even though -- unlike Mamzer -- they apply to only a limited number of generations, just like Edomi and Mitzri), since it is actually more Machmir than Mitzri and Edomi in terms of the number of generations.\n",

      "It is noteworthy that Rashi in his last comment on the Mishnah (100b DH v'Oleh b'Mishmaro) explains that it is the Mishmar who cannot prevent this individual Kohen from serving. Aruch la'Ner expands on this to say that Rashi means to learn a different Pshat in the Gemara later, i.e. it's not against *his* will that he must serve, but rather it is that even against *their* will (of the Bnei Mishmar) he is entitled to serve. Two advantages of this are: a) It resolves Tosfos' Kashya, as the Aruch la'Ner himself notes; and b) it would seem to obviate your excellent question. \n",

      "Thank you answering my previous questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend who's also learning yevamos asked me this question.  Rav Yehuda amar Rav said that the Mishnah which discuses the age of chalitza for a minor girl and [basically] says her chalitza is meaningless is going like Rebbi Meir.  Rebbi is consistent with his Mishnah when he orders Avdan to check whether a girl is a gedola before doing chalitza.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Rebbi changes his opinion after he hears from Rebbi Yishmael bi Rebbi Yosi that Rebbi Yosi holds that a girl can even be a ketana to do chalitza.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Rebbi quoted the halacha in the Mishnah going like Rebbi Meir, then why did he go against this after hearing that Rebbi Yosi held otherwise It's also implied that Rebbi already knew that the chachomim argued on this, when rav Yehuda amar Rav says the Mishnah is Rebbi Meir's opinion, \"but the chachomim argue.\" And still Rebbi stated his Mishnah as to follow Rebbi Meir's opinion, note the chachomim's.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought to answer simply that when Rebbi wrote the Mishnah down he believed Rebbi Meir's opinion to be the halacha over the chachomim's, but he didn't know exactly who the chachomim were, only that there was such an opinion, But after hearing that the chachomim was Rebbi Yosi who was particularly chashuv as the Gemara calls his Beribi,\" Rebbi he changed his mind, and this happened after the Mishnah was already written down.  Just my own answer doesn't feel compelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could you please explain why Rebbi changed his mind from the Mishnah after hearing what Rebbi Yosi held?\n",

      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Shalom Greg!\n",
      "I appreciate reading your insightful comments and question. I strongly identify with what you said about Rebbi Yosi holding great weight in terms of authority to Pasken. This is especially true in the eyes of Rebbi. For example, you may be familiar with two other accounts, cited in Shabbos 51a and Sanhedrin 29a, in which Rebbi submits to the view of Rebbi Yishmael's great father Rebbi Yossi. \n",
      "Regarding why Rebbi changed his mind, a few thoughts seem plausible. \n",
      "First, Rebbi simply could have been unaware until now that Rebbi Yosi espoused the lenient ruling of the Chachamim; just discovering that Rebbi Yosi held by this view was enough to sway Rebbi's opinion. This suggestion might be somewhat tenuous, however, since we know that Rebbi Yosi was a teacher of Rebbi, and as such one might have expected Rebbi to be aware of his master's view. On the other hand, from the story that Rav Kahana recounts on Shabbos 15a, one gets the impression that there were indeed a number of rulings of Rebbi Yosi to which the Chachmei ha'Dor were not privy.\n",
      "Additionally, the great impression that Rebbi Yishmael had upon Rebbi in the moving story of his argument with Avdan might have helped to add even more weight to Rebbi Yishmael and Rebbi Yossi in Rebbi's eyes.\n",
      "Lastly, as a speculation, it is possible that even if Rebbi officially issued a general ruling in accordance with Rebbi Meir, e.g. in the Mishnah, it is possible that in the present case Rebbi chose to humble himself in deference to his superior Rebbi Yossi in order not to offend the fact that Rebbi Yishmael openly expressed his father's view in the current scenario. \n",

Shimon, and that it was a comment of R. Yochanan/R. Yishmael that shed light on that based on a posuk (which itself is a bit hard to understand). If there was a scriptural basis for the takkana, why wasn't it mentioned in the mishnah, and indeed, WHY would we care about a scriptural source at all whenever a takkana is issued by the Sanhedrin, what difference does it make whether or not there was a scriptural basis??!\n",

Surely a Sanhedrin could justify a fence for whatever reason it wished, AND on the other hand, if it WERE based on the case of Amnon and Tamar, we surely wouldn't worry about a specific scriptural basis as mentioned in Kiddushin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it seems strange that it would have taken until Shammai and HIllel to include yichud with an idolatrous woman, since it would be a kal vachomer - if yichud is prevented with a kosher Jewish woman, then al pi kama vekama with an idolatrous woman. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure I understand really why there would be need for a prohibition of yichud with an UNMARRIED woman, since she is permitted  to a man anytime according to basic Talmudic law. Any concern about nidda would be a secondary issue having nothing directly to do with whether or not a woman is permitted.\n",

      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "\n",
      "Shalom R' Goldman,\n",
      "I appreciate seeing that you took effort to examine this Gemara from a number of angles. Yasher Ko'ach!\n",
      "Below I will try to contribute what I hope sheds some light onto your various points of investigation. If you see any gaps or flaws, please let the Kollel know, and someone will try to fill them in. \n",
      "I understand that you are talking about the Isur  Yichud of one man with two women. It sounds like you are assuming that it is a Takana d'Rabanan. That is the view found in Rashba Shu\"t I:587; a supporting Diyuk for this being that the Gemara provides a rationale of \"Daatan Kalos\" which would seem to be superfluous of it is a Din d'Oraisa. \n",
      "However, there are views who maintain that it is Min ha'Torah. See Shu\"t Maharsham III:153 DH v'Hinei.\n",
      "Regarding the citation of scriptural source, we routinely find the Mishnah omitting the source for various laws. Instead, such a discussion of the basis behind the Dinim in the Mishnah would typically be relegated to the Gemara. See Rashi in Bava Metzia Sof 33a DH Gemara.\n",
      "If this law is mid'Rabanan, then when I first considered your question about the significance of having a scriptural source, I suspected simply that the Posuk would confer a stronger legal power to the Din. But I did not see this exact nuance in Mefarshim. \n",
      "Instead, what I find is that the Ritva (Rosh Hashanah 16a DH v'Ha) believes that when there is an Asmachta to a Posuk for a Din d'Rabanan, then it actually means that Hashem Himself believes that this law should be observed, but just He didn't oblige us. Instead, it is Chazal job to take the initiative in making the Takanah. \n",
      "Seen in this way, having a scriptural basis for the Din gives it a stamp of divine approval, so to speak, reflecting Hakadosh Boruch Hu's endorsement of the specific law. \n",
      "Alternatively, we find in Kiryat Sefer (Hakdamah, section #4) that having a scriptural source is actually a critical part of what provide the license to Chazal to establish such a Takanah; meaning, without the Posuk, they wouldn't or couldn't have legislated this particular law.\n",
      "Regarding the need to extend the decree after the case of Amnon and Tamar, I think your logic is right; namely, ideally there should be no reason to decree against Yichud with a Penuyah, as you assumed. But after the story of Amnon and Tamar, Chazal saw that tragically it was necessary in order to prevent that sort of misconduct. \n",
      "Vis a vis the story of Amnon and Tamar being the impetus for the extension of the Yichud decree, a number of times we find that Chazal decide to enact a Takanah -- which they otherwise wouldn't have -- specfically because they saw from a certain incident that unfortunately there was a pressing need for it. For another case like this see for example Mishnah 1:10 in Beitzah.\n",
      "Finally, regarding the need to decree against Yichud with an idolatress, I see two views in the Mefarshim as to why it was not already included beforehand. The Ran (Kidushin 81a) maintains that it is because only Yichud with a Penuyah was common, versus Yichud with a Goya was not common; consequently Chazal didn't decide to include it in the prior decree. \n",
      "The Taz (Even ha'Ezer, Siman 22, Seif Katan 1), on the other hand, believes that the reason a Goya was excluded is because only a Penuyah could potentially involve an Isur d'Oraisa, i.e. when she is a Niddah; unlike a Goya, who mid'Oraisa has no Tumah as a Niddah. As you might know there is more about the successive extensions of the Yichud decree found in Avodah Zarah 36b.\n",

      "Shalom R' Hersh,\n",
      "This is a perceptive question. I see, though, that you only asked in the Ika d'Amri. So it sounds like you didn't find difficulty with the Gemara before the Ika d'Amri. \n",
      "But if I understand your question correctly, you in fact could have asked earlier as well. For the original question posed was: Is the blood independent or connected? The Gemara asked a number of follow up questions, including these:\n",
      "#1) Even if the blood is independent, does the man just intend to take out the blood, in which case the Be'ilah is Mutar; or does he intend to create an opening, in which case it is Asur? \n",
      "#2) And even if he just intends to take out the blood, and the formation of the opening merely constitutes an unintended consequence, still, do we follow Rebbi Shimon that an unintended consequence is Mutar, or Rebbi Yehudah that an unintended consequence is Asur? \n",
      "According to your line of reasoning, here too, why did the Gemara in stage #2 ask if we follow Rebbi Yehudah? Isn't it obvious, from the fact that the Gemara in stage #1 said if he intends for the blood it is Mutar, that that we are following Rebbi Yehudah?\n",
      "Evdently the Pshat is that indeed originally the Gemara assumed like one Tzad; but then later it reconsiders. As if to say that what was concluded previously really hinges on yet a tacit assumption, namely, Rebbi Shimon's view regarding Davar she'Eino Miskaven? \n",
      "In other words, to put it plainly, not every Im Timtzi Lomar is considering a *new* dichotomy that is built *on top* of all the accepted assumptions of the previous step, but rather -- at times, such as in this Sugya -- an Im Timtzi Lomar is in fact reconsidering a prior assumption and clarifying what would result from adopting the contrary view. \n",

      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Shalom R' Goldman,\n",
      "I appreciate your perceptive comments and questions regarding this fascinating issue. \n",
      "First, please let me share that I came across a few interpretations that may overlap with the Perushim you found regarding who this Mal'ach was (other than Metatron, which Rashi and Ramban cite):\n",
      "1. It was Michael, the angel of kindness who is in charge of Divine forgiveness (see Rabeinu Bachaye).\n",
      "2. It was the same angel who appears in Yehoshua 5:14 (see Rashbam).\n",
      "3. It was the Navi Yehoshua (Chizkuni, which it sounds like you have seen already).\n",
      "Your question about Mefarshim contradicting an interpretation found in Chazal reminds me of the Tosfos Yom Tov (Mishnayos Nazir 5:5, Sof DH u'Beis Hillel) who writes that one is allowed to interpret Mikra or Mishnah in a way that differs from the Chachamim of the Talmud, provided it does not contradict the Gemara's Halachic conclusions.\n",
      "In addition, there an important comment of the Rashbam (Bereshis 37:2) which tells us that even though the Ikar study is that of Derash according to Chazal, neverthless it is quite legitimate to alternatively interpret according to Peshuto Shel Mikra, as even the Talmud itself records (Shabbos 63a): Ein Mikra Yotzei Midei Peshuto. \n",
      "As you know, each commentator has their own agenda. For example, a number of Mefarshim -- Rashbam and Ibn Ezra being amongst the most prominent -- will typically try to explain the Pesukim according to what they believe is the most literal or straight forward interpretation, even if that might differ with what we find in Chazal. Others, e.g. Ramban and Malbim, often try to show how the Pshat and Derashos of Chazal actually fit together. \n",
      "I understand your discomfort regarding the very close similarity to Hashem which Chazal attribute to Metatron. I can refer you to a few sources that might help partially clarify this issue:\n",
      "A. Ramban (Shemos 23:20; 12:12 DH u'Vechol) explains that this angel is the same as the Mal'ach ha'Goel (Bereishis 48:16); and his name (resembling the Greek word \"metator\" for guide) indicates that it is a Moreh Derech. For examplw, we find in Sifri (Ha'azinu #338) that Metatron showed Moshe all of Eretz Yisrael; likewise in the Aruch (under the entry \"Metatr\") Balak heard that Bilam was approaching because he sent Metatron before him.\n",
      "B. Ohr Hachayim (Shemos 23:20) clarifies that this angel is not just a servant like other typical angels of God, but rather he is a great angel who (as Ramban above also alluded) redeemed the Avos. \n",
      "C. As some background on the different levels of angels, I can point you to the Derech Hashem (Part 1, Chapter 5) who describes the difference between two types of \"Nivdalim\", or spiritual beings: one type is called Kochos, which commentaries explain refer to \"Serafim\", as in Yeshayah 6:2, who exist in the world of Beriah; versus the other type which are called Mal'achim, who are elsewhere called \"Chayos\", as in echezkel 1:5 and 10:15, existing in the world of Yetzirah. \n",

      "I will add something you may already be aware of. I am just reminding you, since it could be relevant to a case of Safek Mamzeres. A Vadai Mamzeres may marry a Vadai Mamzer, but a Safek Mamzeres is forbidden mid'Rabanan from marrying a Vadai Mamzer.

The Gemara at the bottom however says, Lo Yetayel Adam v'Kordkisin b'Soch Beiso which would seem to indicate that it is only prohibited inside but permissible outside. If so, the Gemara on top could have answered from the case of b'Kordkisin which seems to be a more common occurrence than the situation of R. Yehudah.\n",

      "\n",
      "Shalom R' Kuhnreich,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. This is a very interesting point. I will offer a couple of suggestions that I hope shed some light. \n",
      "First, the mainstream interpretation of this Gemara would say that on Yom Kippur Kordekisin are actually Asur both inside and outside. \n",
      "If so, you might ask, why does the Beraisa speak specifically about a case *inside* one's house. There are a number of interpretations. \n",
      "One group of Rishonim learn that this is because of the implied Diyuk in the Seifa: Anpilya are Mutar *only* indoors, but not outdoors. \n",
      "But why are Anpilya Asur outdoors? Some Mefarshim, such as the Ritva, believe it is because of the prohibition of carrying. Since the Anpilya are not a Min'al, therefore it is not a Beged, and hence it will be Asur mid'Oraisa because of Hotza'ah. \n",
      "On the other hand, others, such as the Meiri, maintain that Anpilya is Asur outdoors because even though the Anpilya is not a Min'al, nevertheless it has the appearance of a real Min'al which is forbidden on Yom Kippur. As such, to wear the Anpilya outside in view of the public eye is Asur mid'Rabanan because of Maris Ayin.\n",
      "By the way, one could suggest theoretically two Nafka Minahs between these views: One Nafka Minah would be wearing Anpilya in a Reshus ha'Yachid that is very populated (e.g. a stadium or indoor shopping center). According to the Ritva, that should be Mutar since there is no prohibition of carrying in a Reshus ha'Yachid; according to the Meiri, however, it would be Asur, since there are many people who would see what you're wearing. \n",
      "Conversely, a second Nafka Minah could be wearing Anpilya in a Reshus ha'Rabim where no other Jews can see you. According to the Ritva that should be Asur since there exists the prohibition of carrying in the Reshus ha'Rabim; according to the Meiri, however, it would be Mutar since no Jew can see and misjudge what you're wearing. \n",
      "Another view in the Rishonim, however, learns that the Beraisa focuses on the case of wearing the shoes indoors because of the Chidush in the Reisha. Rashba suggests two explanations of what this is: First, to teach the extremely stringent law the Kordekisin are Asur *even* inside (needless to say outside). \n",
      "Second, it is a Chidush to say that Kordekisin are Asur even when you are wearing them for only an ostensibly brief period of time in order to go to a place (even indoors) that is wet and your sole intention is not for comfort but to protect you -- or at least your shoes (see below) -- from the moisture.\n",
      "However, even though we see that wearing the Kordekisin is Asur on Yom Kippur, still it is Mutar during the week. If that is the case, your question stands: Why did the Gemara, when seeking an example of one show being worn on top of the other, need to come onto the case of Rav Yehudah who wore 5 pairs of Mukei?  Why wasn't it enough to cite the example of Kordekisin which can be worn on weekday (even if not on Yom Kippur)? \n",
      "Having failed to yet find Mefarshim who address this excellent query of yours directly, I believe the answer is because Kordekisin are essentially not really shoes for covering the foot which would be required for Chalitzah. Rather, as Rashi (102b DH Kordekisin) writes, they are meant to go on the bottom of ones shoes in order to protect the shoe from getting wet. \n",
      "So this is not like the case of Rav Yehudah who was wearing multiple pairs of actual shoes over his feet. I see from Mefarshim of Rashi (DH b'Muk, near the end of 102b) that Rav Yehudah's shoes were high topped and covered hs legs almost up to his knee. Again this would place Mukei in contradistinction with the Kordekisin which are more like accessories for protection of the shoes.\n",
      "Yasher Ko'ach for your insightful question. You opened up greater understanding into this Gemara. \n",
      "I hope this helps!\n",

      "Metaphorically evident in Genesis 2:9, The Lord G-d caused to grow the tree of life (His Torah) in the middle of the garden (planet earth), and the tree of knowledge (of His commandments, laws, and mitzvot) was (awareness) of all good and evil at first breath.   \n",
      "\n",
      "If Adam and Eve then had free will choice to eat from the forbidden tree and obtain His Torah commandments and before eating that they would obtain complete Torah knowledge but  eventually suffer death, would this indicate that all humans are responsible for their actions?   \n",
      "\n",
      "Then with knowledge of His Torah commandments, Cain murdered Abel, the earth was flooded killing everyone except Noah and his progenitors of humanity, Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed, and over the millennia holocausts perpetrated by many nations with full knowledge of G-d's Torah.\n",

      "Shalom R' Mandel,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very nice question! \n",
      "I see that you have studied fine subtleties and offered deep interpretatitons. Yasher koach! I will only try to offer some points that will hopefully expand the discussion.\n",
      "1. You wrote: \"The Lord G-d caused to grow the tree of life (His Torah)\". \n",
      "Your interpretation reminds one of Mishlei 3:18 that advances the a metaphor.\n",
      "2. You wrote: \"the middle of the garden (planet earth)\".\n",
      "Very interesting point. Indeed, at the time this was the only area populated by humans. \n",
      "3. You wrote: \"tree of knowledge (of His commandments, laws, and mitzvot)\".\n",
      "Some commentaries interpret the knowledge as a reference to free will choice. See for example Ramban and ha'Ksav v'ha'Kabalah; also see the interpretation of Targum Onkelos to Bereishis 3:22, which is also reflected in Rambam (Hilchos Teshuvah 5:1). \n",
      "4. You wrote: \"obtain His Torah commandments\".\n",
      "Fascinating. Contrastingly, one might be tempted to argue that Adam and Chavah were given just one command, i.e. to not eat from the Tree of Knowledge. However, we might find that interpretation to be lacking, since after all, they were told/blessed to be fruitful and multiply (but see Yevamos 65b, Tosfos s.v. v'Lo). Moreover, Chazal understand basic \"Noachide\" laws also to have been given in the narrative of Adam (Sanhedrin 56b).\n",
      "5. You wrote: \"but eventually suffer death\".\n",
      "You may be familiar with the explanation of the Ramban (Bereishis 2:17), that the \"death penalty\" was not to die immediately, but rather to become mortal. \n",
      "6. You wrote: \"all humans are responsible for their actions\".\n",
      "Very nice point. You may also have seen, for example, Bereishis 4:7 and Rambam Hilchos Teshuvah (especially 5:3).\n",
      "7. You wrote: \"Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed...with full knowledge of G-d's Torah.\"\n",
      "See the explanation (I think it is Derashos Haran, but I cannot find it at the moment) that Sodom was punished even though caring for the poor is not one of the seven laws given to Noach. See also Malbim on Yechezkel 16:49.\n",
      "8. You wrote: \"Would Hashem destroyed so many men, women and children who didn't have Torah knowledge that they were committing evil in His sight?\".\n",
      "This is a very deep question. Maybe you will have an opportunity to see material on this, for example, in Derech Hashem 2:2-3, and also in the Ramban's explanation of the book of Iyov.\n",

      "kerfish,>Dear Kerfish,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very nice question! \n",
      "There are four main opinions in the Rishonim, mostly found in the commentaries to Gitin 36.\n",
      "1. Ramban: Shemitah nowadays applies on the Torah level. He bases this ruling on the majority view of the Chachamim.\n",
      "2. Most Rishonim (see Rashba, Ritva, Ran): Shemitah nowadays applies only on the Rabbinic level. This is based on the view of Rebbi, who maintains that the laws of Shemitah only apply when the laws of Yovel apply. Yovel only applies when all or most of the Jewish people live in Israel [1]. \n",
      "(See Rashi and Tosfos who dispute how the Drashah of Rebbi operates, and also whether or not the laws of Yovel applied during Second Temple).\n",
      "3. Baal ha'Maor (see Sefer ha'Terumah): Shemitah does not apply nowadays at all, except as a Midas Chasidus. The Raavad once held this view but later retracted from it. In Shulchan Aruch, after the Mechaber rules that Shemitas Kesafim is Rabbinic today, the Rema cites this view as a Limud Zechus for why many communities had not observed Shemitas Kesafim.\n",
      "4. Rambam: Shemitas *Kesafim* is only Rabbinic nowadays. Opinions differ whether Rambam also believes that Shemitas *Karka* today is a Torah obligation (Kesef Mishnah learns this way) or only Rabbinic (see the other commentaries on the Rambam). \n",

      "1. https://www.sefaria.org.il/Arakhin.32b.16?lang=he>Thank you for your reply.  According to the second opinion you cited (the rov rishonim, Ritva Rashba and Ran) If we would theoretically in our days have most Jews living in Eretz Yisrael (something which is probably eventually going to happen) would shemitah then become deorisa?  Also why is there no Shemitah today according to the Baal Hamoar (opinion 3)?>Dear Kerfish,\n",
      "You are welcome. \n",
      "Some point out [1] that inherently Klal Yisrael dwelling in Eretz Yisrael is only a condition for the release of slaves; just since slave release is one of the necessary conditions for Yovel to operate [2], therefore Yovel is not activated unless we are dwelling in Eretz Yisrael. Some write accordingly [3] that according to the views that slave release is not a necessary condition for Yovel, consequently Yovel will be operative even when Klal Yisrael is not dwelling in Israel, just without the laws of slave release.\n",
      "But more directly related to your point, Rishonim [4] write that even if the presence of even one Shevet is missing from Eretz Yisrael then Yovel does not apply. \n",
      "There is yet another Machlokess whether in order for Yovel to operate it is enough to have even a minority of each Shevet [5] or do we need a majority of each Shevet.\n",
      "So I hope these all these views don't dissuade the optimism of Yovel revivalists, but we get the impression that only when Eliyahu ha'Navi and Mashiach will be here that we will resume observance of Yovel, and thus Shemitah on a Torah level.\n",
      "The Ba'al ha'Maor maintained that there can be no Yovel, even on a rabbinic level, after the destruction of Bayis Sheni, when the Sanhedrin stopped counting to be Mekadesh each cycle.\n",

      "I notice that you raise Kashyas that many great Mefarshim grapple with. Yasher Koach! For example, I saw a comment of the Chidushei ha'Iluy me'Meitchet that could interest you regarding this discussion. He points out an apparent Stirah in the words of Rashbam in the section of Bava Basra that we mentioned above. Because at first Rashbam explains that Shmuel agrees that we follow Rov in matters of Isur, *for example* meat from one of ten stores etc. That is a case of Ruba d'Isa Kaman. So the implication would be that in a case of Mamon analogous to this, i.e. Isa Kaman, then Shmuel would say we do not follow Rov. However, later in the Sugya, when Shmuel is explaining how his view can even fit with R' Acha, Rashbam indicates that Shmuel only argues in the case of Leisa Kaman, but he agrees to Rav in a monetary case of Isa Kaman!\n",

      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Dear R' Menachem,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very nice question! I see there are a few approaches in the commentaries to answer it.\n",
      "1. Rashi (s.v. My Nihu): True, it is forbidden to steal. And the Gemara could have raised this objection, but instead chose to raise a stronger objection, i.e. that Eved Ivri was not Noheg in that time period. (Rashi explains the reason why the second objection is stronger is because the first one could be answered by following the opinion of Rebbi Eliezer that even if a person become an Eved by selling himself -- i.e. without stealing -- can be with a Shifchah.) \n",
      "2. Tosfos Rid (s.v. d'Minsav): He actually would be allowed to steal, since he planned to pay back plus the fact that his intention was to purify his offspring. (See the Rambam Gneivah 1:1-2. Chasam Sofer (Bava Metzia 61b s.v. Lo Tignovu) understands him to mean that stealing with intent to give back is only forbidden rabbinically. Some suggest that this Tosfos Rid appears to hold likewise.)\n",
      "3. Netziv (Meromei Sadeh s.v. Amar Leih): To steal with intent to improve the item is permitted mid'Oraisa, and under these circumstances Chazal would permit what would normally be a rabbinic prohibition.\n",
      "4. Tosfos Harosh (s.v. Zil): He would have to find a \"victim\" who would be willing to forgive the theft. I see those who ask a Kashya on this, namely, that ostensibly there would be no Aveirah of Theft, and hence no Din Mechirah if the person is Mochel. It is possible that the Tosfos Harosh himself tries to preempt this objection. You can find his words in the link below. \n",

      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Dear R' Menachem,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very nice question! \n",
      "I understand you are referring to cases of Chezkas Shalosh p'Amim, such as:\n",
      "a. a goring ox (Bav Kama 23b);\n",
      "b. brothers who die becuse of Milah (Yevamos 64b); or\n",
      "c. Vestos (Nidah 63b).\n",
      "In those cases, I see commentaries are actually divided as to why Davka three times is enough. Here are a few views found in R' Achikam Keshet's wonderful Sefer Kovetz Yesodos v'Chakiros:\n",
      "1. Yehusei Tanaim v'Amoraim (page 296): Once a pattern repeats a few times, we have the right to assume it will continue in that fashion. This would make it like a Chazakah d'me'Ikara. \n",
      "2. Kuntres ha'Chazakos (2) [by the author of Shemen Rokeach]: It is a Takanah of Chazal to establish the assumed status based on a repeated number of times.\n",
      "3. Reshimos Shiurim ha'Grid (Bava Kama 2, Tosfos s.v. u'Milsa): Two distinct factors: One being a logical presumption that this repeated behavior is revealing to us the nature of the creature/person (this would be an actual Birur), the second being a Gzeras ha'Kasuv that the applied status of Muad takes legal effect only after three occurrences have taken place (this would be just a Hanhagah).\n",
      "One might be tempted to argue that the rationales above do not easily transfer to the case of how many times one must learn a portion of Torah knowledge in order to understand and help remember it. \n",
      "What we do find in the Gemara (Eruvin 54b) is two views (Chazal in another place -- see Midrash cited by Maharsha -- indicate that there is no Machlokess). R' Akiva actually says that the Rebbe must teach his Talmid as many times as necessary, even if that is well above four. It is R' Eliezer who maintains that four is the special number required. \n",
      "However, here the commentaries differ whether four is the *maximal* amount, beyond which the Rebbe is not required to surpass, even for slower students (see Maharsha, Chidushei Agados s.v. R' Akiva); or is it rather a *minimal* amount, less than which a Rebbe must not labor, even for gifted students who understand quickly, e.g. after just one or two times. I will add that Yaavetz comments that this rule particularly applied in the times when Torah teaching was done orally, but not today when there are Sefarim available from which to learn.\n",

      "\n",
      "Lenny Bogatin  asks:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gemorah (and Ran) dismiss R' Zeira suggestion that R' Eliezer (or R' Elazar) could have the opinion (as per a Mishna in Tohoras) that a doubtful Nazirus should be treated leniently.   The Gemarah with Ram come up with a Rabinial matter (of Safek liquid) that R' Eliezer holds stringently (as tamey),   and, therefore, make a resolution that R' Eliezer could not at the same time treat a more important Torah level   case of Nazirus (when in Safek) in a lenient fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, is that logic really 100% applicable? \n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, as Gemorah points out, if we hold like Shmuel, and consider that liquids CAN become tamey even on the Torah's level, then there is no easy comparison to be made to the case of Safek Nasirus, as we wouldn't be comparing Rabbinical vs Torah level matters, but  only Torah to Torah subjects that would be easier to defend.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, on that point (as per Shmuel's version) alone - Gemorah should not be dismissing R' Zeira's position. \n",
      "1.  So, why does it ?\n",
      "\n",
      "But, secondly, even if we hold like Rav, and do accept that we have a Rabbinical Level case of Safek liquids (that are held stingently by R' Eliezer) vs. Tora Level Safek Nazirus (held leniently by R' Eliezer) why should we think of that as absolutely not compatible positions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Just because it sounds 'unreasonable' to Gemorah (as per Ran), does it make it really impossible?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why can't we say that R' Eliezer may have his own opinion regarding what should be strict and what not?  Ran explains that R' Eliezer is entitled to hold an 'unconventional' view to treat the Rabbinical level (Tamei Liquids)  in Safek in a strict fashion !  That view allows us to explain how, on the one hand, R' Eliezer says in a Braisa that Tumah does not apply to liquids, at all. And on the other hand, he agreed with R' Meir's words that even (only Rabbinically possible) tamey liquid would be tamey when in Safek.  This position would be unconventional as Safek Rabbinical level matter normally would be treated leniently.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, knowing that R' Eliezer is not shy to hold sometimes his 'own' unconventioanal positions, why can't  we assume that R' Eliezer would look at the case of doubtful Nazirus (even though it's a Torah Level issue) in a lenient (!) light based, for instance, on these 2 considerations:\n",
      " \n",
      "2.   Yes, when it comes to 'property', not affecting the 'body',  R' Elieser may be strict even in cases involving        Rabbinical matters (like the Safek-ly tamei liquids) ...    but, in the more 'personal' matter (even when dealing        with Torah level matters) like Nazirus, he might be more  forgiving.   Why not ??\n",
      "\n",
      "or/and:\n",
      "\n",
      "3.   Granted, when it comes to Torah level matters (like Nazirus), initiated by a 'dumb' human, maybe even by mistake pronouncing his own 'hardship', he should be held accountable for it.       \n",
      "\n",
      "But, if H-m decides to step in, and works it out in such a way that that poor soul's words become (or remain) a Safek (not determined, like in the case of 100 kors in a pile that got lost), maybe R' Eliezer feels that in such case it is an Indication that H-m does NOT want to hold him responsible for his loose tongue!         \n",
      "\n",
      "By treating this case leniently we would just yield to H-m's 'hint'.  And we can combine this notion with the idea above, that this kind of leniency only works with person's body matters, and not with his property items (like ?tamey? liquids).      \n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, R' Zeira (about R' Elizer) doesn't have a 100% proof for these considerations to be valid or not, but he may still be right that it was R' Eiezer (just like, maybe, R.Yehuda, or/and others) who holds that Safek Nazirut is NOT valid.     So, why is the Gemorah's editor so dismissive of R' Zeira (or R'  Eliezer) ? \n",

      "Moshe\n",
      "------------------------------------\n",
      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Dear R' Moshe,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very nice questions! I checked in Mesivta for number of insights that help shed light on these important issues that you raised. Let me share with you some of what I found.\n",
      "1. Wonderful question. I can share some background before getting to a potential answer. First, the Ritva here writes that the reason to count from Nisan for us, as opposed to Tishrei for them, is in order to distinguish between the kings of Israel versus the kings of other nations.\n",
      "He says that Israel counts from Nisan which is based on Yetzias Mitzrayim, since that is the point when we became a sovreign people, not subjugated by another power e.g. Pharaoh in Egypt. This is unlike the nations of the world, who count from Tishrei since they are only related to the world at large either by virtue of existence [Tishrei is when the world was created] or by virtue of the judgment that takes place for all mankind [this judgment day occurs on the first of Tishrei].\n",
      "In an expansion of this line of thought, the Chasam Sofer (Shu\"t, Choshen Mishpat, Siman 1) elaborates on the reason for the distinction: A gentile's worth and virtue lie in his status of being a creature of Hashem; thus, they are counted from Tishrei when the world was created. On the other hand, a Jew's worth and virtue lie in his status of being a servant of Hashem; hence, we count from Nisan when Hashem took us to be His loyal servants.\n",
      "Even further, the Yad Mitzrayim (Rav Yitzchak Isaac Chaver's Peirush on the Hagadah Shel Pesach) explains that a goy lives within the bounds of natural order, as symbolized in the date of Creation in Tishrei; whereas a Jew lives according to the divine will above and beyond nature law, as expressed in the Yetzias Mitzrayim.\n",
      "Accordingly, one could argue that we only count from Nisan for a king who is both Jewish himself and also he rules over the Jewish people, since arguably this would best portray the self-sovreignty that the Ritva expressed. I believe the Ran on Daf 2b (2a in the Rif) also indicates this interpretation. If so, then in your case of the Jewish king of England it would seem reasonable to count from Tishrei, not Nisan.\n",
      "2. Very good point. Indeed the commentaries (e.g. Beis Meir, et al) are bothered by this. Specifically, the Midrash (Vayikra Rabah, end of Parshas Shemini, 13:5; Esther Rabah, Ch. 8) reports that Koresh was the Jewish son of Esther, which is a reflection of the fact that when a Jewish woman bears a child, even if the father is a gentile, the child is nevertheless a bona fide Jew (Yevamos 45b; Rambam, Isurei Biah 15:3). If so, ask the commentaries, why do we need to resort to the fact that he was [at least for a time] a Kosher king. Even if he weren't, still we should count from Nisan since he is Jew! Several answers are offered. Here are some of them:\n",
      "a. Yad Yosef: Even if the king is Jewish, nevertheless, if the people who put him in charge are gentiles, and the populace over whom he rules is comprised of [primarily] gentiles, then we do not count from Nisan. [I would comment that this seems to be in consonance with the conclusion which we inferred in our discussion above in part 1.]\n",
      "b. Beis Yitzchak (Vol. I, Even ha'Ezer, Siman 29): This Gemara is a reflection of the view of the Maharit Algazi, that such a child's status actually depends on how and with whom he is raised and educated. If amongst Jews, then indeed he will be viewed as a Jew. However, if amongst goyim, as Koresh was [despite his mother being Jewish], then he has the status of a goy. \n",
      "c. Shu\"t MiMaamakim (2:25): The Vlad of such a union will indeed be Kosher, but he still needs a Geirus. I would also invite you to read about the views which say that Koresh was a gentile, which you can find in the discussion on the Kollel website at this link: https://dafyomi.co.il/rhashanah/insites/rh-dt-003.htm\n",
      "3. Excellent point. Perhaps we can suggest, particularly according to those Mefarshim (in part 1 of our discussion above) who explained why in the first place there is a distinction between Jewish kings versus gentile kings, that the rationale(s) for associating the Jewish kings with Nisan and Yetzias Mitzrayim and the gentile kings with Tishrei is such an important consideration in terms of Jewish outlook and values, that it overrides the fact that under such a system one must be a little more diligent to avoid bookkeeping errors. \n",

      "Shalom aleichem R' Zaman,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very nice questions! \n",
      "In many ways you know more about Chakiros it than I do. But I will share my thoughts anyway.\n",
      "At times, a Chakirah is demonstrably \"true\". That is, it can shown explicitly or implicitly from sources that each opinion indeed holds like either Tzad of the Chakirah. \n",
      "Perhaps more often, though, a Chakirah is more \"speculative\". In other words, we don't have ironclad proof, let's say, that this is what the Rambam and Raavad actually each held. And yet, nevertheless, it is still a valid form of analytical study, and worthy Amelus b'Torah. \n",
      "And, indeed, in such a case, one could argue that the merit of the Chakirah, as you perceptively noted, would lie in it's power to explain the rulings and opinions that we do in fact observe in the words of Chazal and Rishonim. \n",
      "As a warning, however, we could add that all this is provided that the Chakirah, however clever it sounds, is not be demonstrably false, perhaps based on other sources that may not have been examined yet. \n",
      "One must be fair to first amass the requisite Bekius before embarking on speculations. As Chazal say (Horayos 14a and Berachos 61a) Sinai has precedence over Oker Harim, since everyone -- including those who wish to engage in penetrating analysis -- needs a supply of raw material to be studied. And, as Rav Chaim Brisker, one of the greatest deep analytical thinkers, is reported to have commented, if someone says a Chidush without mastery of all Shas, then it is Pilpul Shel Hevel.\n",
      "To summarize, then, I would classify a Chakirah as being legitimate and worthy if it meets one of two conditions:\n",

      "2. Not demonstrably true or false, but helpful in explaining. \n",

However, since there was a second Petirah, they didn't want to permit all actions completely. So, Chazal wanted a compromise solution, i.e. to *partially* observe the Isurim for the second Avelus. In this way, since the Isur is relaxed, it will not be too much for the Avel to manage; yet at the same time, since some level of Isurim still exist, he will not divert his mind too much from the second Avelus. Practically, though, there are a number of possiblities how to structure and maintain the *limited* Isurim of the second Avelus:\n",
      "1. To relax them in *quantity*. In other words to bathe/shave/launder would be permitted, but *only* on a day on which they are strongly needed, but not on other days.\n",
      "2. To relax them in *quality*. In other words bathe/shave/launder would be permitted on *any* day, but must be done only in a fashion that deviates from the norm. \n",
      "I would understand one reason Chazal might not wish to go with option #1 is because Chazal prefer to have a uniform Takanah that fits everyone the same, not a Takanah that applies different people differently. The concept \"Nasata Divarecha l'Shiurin\" is a principle found in Shas (Shabbos 35b, Bava Basra 29a, Megilah 18b, Gitin 14a, Chulin 32a) and Mefarshim.\n",
      "Perhaps therefore Chazal chose option #2, and specifically limited Kibus to be without detergent, bathing without hot water, and shaving without a regular instrument.\n",
      "You astutely pointed out that Rashi differs with the Girsa that we have, which alleviates the weight of your Kashya. To balance some weight to the other side, I see the Rosh (Moed Katan 3:18) has our Girsa. \n",
      "I hope this helps!\n",

      "Great to hear from you. Very nice question -- Yasher koach!\n",
      "To my dismay, I didn't see Mefarshim discuss it directly. But with your persmission, is there room to suggest the following options? I believe they are not mutually exclusive, so hypothetically more than one could be true. \n",
      "1. Generally speaking it is harder to two believe that two people are both telling the same bluff, since they would have to coordinate and collude together. As opposed to one person's claim, which might be a cheap and easy fabrication of his own. This is reflected in Tanach both by Izevel (Melachim I 21:13) and of course in actual law (Devarim 19:15).\n",
      "2. Possibly, each brother on his own would not have the courage to take the blame himself. By going into this together as a team, they could Michazek and encourage each other to go through with it. \n",
      "3. Two men might have appear to have been needed for the planning and execution of the attack. Since the girl had the esteemed status of being the king's daughter, practially, it is less likely to imagine that one person alone could have managed to kill her. The mission perhaps would need to involve by-passing palace security etc. \n",
      "4. Chazal tell us that the eternal reward of these heroes is tremendous. Perhaps they both wanted to be privileged with this Zechus. \n",
      "5. They didn't have ample time to patiently plan this mission with a Cheshbon how to save their own skins. They just blurted out on the spur of the moment, \"What do you want from the Jewish people? We did it!\" Personally I wouldn't normally dare to suggest this, but the Lashon in links #1 and #2 might actually hint toward this possibility. \n",
      "As an aside, to see connections to this story in modern Halachic discussion, I invite you to check Chazon Ish (Y.D. 69:1) who explains why it may be permissible to steer a missile away from a group of victims even if it will strike a smaller group of people who otherwise would have been safe, and Igros Moshe (Y.D.

      "Dear R' Michael,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Very nice question! \n",
      "This distinction that you identified might be understood in the larger context of a key difference between the Bavli and the Yerushalmi, with which I am sure you are familiar. That is, the Bavli underwent a more lengthy and thorough process of composition, concluding about 150 years after the Yerushalmi, thus leaving more time for refined editing and redaction. \n",
      "You and I find this reflected in the fact that the Pshat in the Bavli is typically more understandable and less ambiguous than is Yerushalmi. Moreover, the Yerushalmi's language is typically more terse, often omitting elaborations that are found in Bavli; also, the Yerushalmi leaves a larger portion of its queries unresolved.\n",
      "One specific point of style that might best help place your point in perspective is that the Yerushalmi often -- presumably for the reasons we mentioned above -- does not explicitly signify and label all parts of the Shakla v'Tarya. For example, unlike Bavli, a question in the Yerushalmi might not be introduced with the familiar terms \"Boyi\", \"Iboya Lehu\", or \"Mahu\"; or we might find distinct stages of the debate in Yerushalmi appearing consecutively without terms to indicate a break between one and the next. \n",
      "In light of this background, perhaps we are not suprised when see that the editors of the Yerushalmi did feel (or have) the need to place a Teiku at the end of every unsolved question. \n",

      "You may have seen the Mishnah Berurah's way of expressing this issue regarding your question. I understand him [1] to mean that since the greatest issue at stake is showing honor for the dead (which is why we try to get the Meis buried as soon as possible even if that means asking gentiles on Yom Tov), then since Shabbos and Yom Kippur are viewed by people as stricter days, and thus when Melachah done on Shabbos or Yom Kippur for Meis, even by gentiles, it actually detracts from Kavod ha'Meis rather than adding to it, therefore it is better not to ask gentiles to bury the body, unlike Yom Tov. \n",
      "It reminds me of the regular law of hastening a burial, even on a regular weekday. This is done to impart honor to the departed. Since that is the reason, it therefore follows that delaying is actually permitted when it will translate into a greater Kavod for the Meis [2].\n",

      "You may have seen the Mishnah Berurah's way of expressing this issue regarding your question. I understand him [1] to mean that since the greatest issue at stake is showing honor for the dead (which is why we try to get the Meis buried as soon as possible even if that means asking gentiles on Yom Tov), then since Shabbos and Yom Kippur are viewed by people as stricter days, and thus when Melachah done on Shabbos or Yom Kippur for Meis, even by gentiles, it actually detracts from Kavod ha'Meis rather than adding to it, therefore it is better not to ask gentiles to bury the body, unlike Yom Tov. \n",
      "It reminds me of the regular law of hastening a burial, even on a regular weekday. This is done to impart honor to the departed. Since that is the reason, it therefore follows that delaying is actually permitted when it will translate into a greater Kavod for the Meis [2].\n",

      "Dear Sholem,\n",
      "I see now that the Ramban deals more expansively with your question [1], and offers several reasons to distinguish between Shabbos and Yom Tov, as follows:\n",
      "A. Many types of Melachah are already permitted on Yom Tov (e.g. cooking and carrying). Therefore, the prohibition to perform Melachah on Yom Tov is less well known to people, unlike Shabbos on which people know that all Melachah is strictly forbidden. The implication being, that when a gentile does Melachah for us on Yom Tov by burying the dead, Chazal felt there was less of a concern that it would lead to a Zilzul of the day, unlike on Shabbos which would be more sensitive to Zilzul. [This is how the Oz v'Hadar Mishnah Berurah (Siman 526, Seif 3) explains this part of the Ramban.]\n",
      "B. Just like Machshirin are permitted for Simchas Yom Tov (e.g. extiguishing a burning log that is making your house uncomfortably smokey -- see Beitzah 22), so too burying the Meis makes your house more comfortable to live in. So Chazal did not forbid asking a gentile in this case. \n",
      "C. Since burial will provide more respect for the dead, therefore Chazal chose not to forbid Amirah l'Nochri on Yom Tov, since Melachah on Yom Tov in the first place is only an Isur Lav, unlike on Shabbos which is an Isur Sekilah (see Beitzah 21 and Yevamos 114 for a precedent for this Chiluk), even though normally Chazal did not distinguish between these two levels, since they are both Torah prohibitions (as the Ramban himself cites from Yevamos 94).\n",
      "D. It would be too shameful for the Meis himself if Melachah was done for him on the holy day of Shabbos (even by gentiles).\n",
      "As we discussed, it the last answer that was apparently accepted by Tosfos, as well as Magen Avraham and Mishnah Berurah.\n",

      "\n",
      "A. Rav Shimon ben Moshe Bloch, of 18th century Hamburg, in his commentary on the Mishnah, called \"Tosafot Chadashim\" at the beginning of Pirkei Avot writes [1]: The level of Beis Shammai is greater than that of Beis Hillel, and therefore in the time of Redemption, may it come speedily in our days, the Halachah will follow Beis Shammai. But now in this world, we follow Beis Hillel, because Beis Shammai is too lofty for this world too handle. \n",
      "The Hebrew is: \n",
      "שמעתי בשם הרב הגאון אב ב״ד מניקלשפורג על משנה ב״ש במקום ב״ה אינו משנה כי מדריגת ב״ש היא גדולה ממדריגת ב״ה. ולכך כשיבא הגואל ב״ב אז יהיה הלכה בב״ש. לכך עתה בזה העולם הלכה כב״ה כי מדריגת ב״ש היא למעלה מזה העולם ואין זה העולם יכול לסבול אותו.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Rav Shalom ben Moshe Buzaglo, of 18th century Morocco, in his commentary on the Zohar, called \"Mikdash Melech\", on page 17a of Bereishis, writes [2]: \"Beis Shammai views are also rooted in an upper source, and thus even though Halachah does not follow Beis Shammai in this world, nevertheless in the future their view will endure. Like the Arizal says that in the times of Mashiach, Halachah will follow Beis Shammai.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Rav Meir Leibush ben Yehiel Michel Wisser, of 19th century Romania, in his commentary on the Chumash, called \"Torah Ohr\", in chapter 19 of Bamidbar, writes [3] (again based on the Arizal, who in turn is based on Pesukim [4] and Chazal [5]) that the reason why the Halachah does not follow Beis Shammai -- nor Rebbe Shimon bar Yochai for that matter -- is because they were so spiritual and above this physical world; but in the future when the soul will be separate from the body, then the Halachah will follow their views.\n",

      "I see that the Yam Shel Shlomo (Siman 32) actually offers the following two explanations.\n",
      "#1) Rav Ada argues on Shmuel (according to Rambam, et al):\n",
      "Rav Ada does not subscribe to Shmuel's method of salting the extra pieces precisely because it accrues no benefit for Yom Tov. Rather, Rav Ada maintains that one *must* engage in the Ha'aramah of changing one's mind from one piece to another, in order that at the time of each act of salting there he is accomplishing a genuine benefit for Yom Tov. \n",
      "#2) Rav Ada agrees with Shmuel (according to Semag, et al):\n",
      "Rav Ada is just adding an equally acceptable alternative method of salting the extra meat; that is, by engaging in Ha'aramah in separate acts piece by piece. But Rav Ada would agree that Shmuel's method is acceptable also, since it all one act. Either avenue of Heter is OK: A single act even though part of it is not for Yom Tov, or a series of many Ha'aramah actions where each one is expressly for Yom Tov. \n",

      "I see now that this issue was discussed by Tosfos on 12a. The Mishnah had taught that Beis Shammai forbid carrying a child/Lulav/Sefer Torah in the Reshus ha'Rabim, whereas Beis Hillel permit. The Gemara first assumed that the two opinions are arguing whether we say Mitoch (Beis Hillel) or not (Beis Shammai). Rabbah, however, suggested that they both do not subscribe to Mitoch, and instead the crux of their Machlokess is whether Eruv/Hotzaah is forbidden on Yom Tov (Beis Shammai) or not (Beis Hillel). \n",
      "Rashi (\"b'Eruv Hotzaah\") explains that to mean Beis Shammai view carrying as a Melachah that is forbidden on Yom Tov and accordingly Chazal enacted Eruv Chatzeros, whereas Beis Hillel do not count carrying as a forbidden Melachah on Yom Tov at all, thus obviating the need for any Takanah of Eruv Chatzeros. \n",
      "Tosfos (\"Dilma\"), however, wonder why according to Beis Shammai there would be any need for a Takanah of Eruv, since carrying is Mutar on Yom Tov if it is for a need. Tosfos offers two resolutions. First, the explanation of Rav Chayim Kohen, according to which the Gemara never discussed Eruv Chatzeros, only the Melachah of carrying. Second, a defense for Rashi's Pshat, that an Eruv is needed for when the carrying is being done not for any need of Yom Tov.\n",
      "It could be argued that the Machlokess between these two interpretations is parallel to the Machlokess between the two interpretations of the Ran on Daf 16. More specifically, we can sy: Tosfos' defense/interpretation of Rashi on 12a definitely follows the first Pshat in the Ran (carrying to the Chatzer not for a need of Yom Tov is forbidden without an Eruv); and it is possible -- but not proven based on what I have seen -- that Rav Chayim Kohen follows the second Pshat of the Ran (becuse most carrying is Mutar, Chazal did not enact an Isur for Chatzeros at all).\n",
      "The Rashba on Daf 12a (\"Mikol Makom\") in fact adopts the first view of the Ran (like Rashi according to Tosfos).\n",
      "I see Mesivta cites the Ra'ah as maintaining the position that even though, without an Eruv, only carrying for a need of Yom Tov is permitted, and an Eruv in fact will permit more (like Rashi/Tosfos/Rashba and the premise of your original question), still carrying is considered to be a sufficiently permissible activity such that creating an Eruv on Yom Tov for the next day Shabbos is not goint to be forbidden. \n",
      "So, to summarize the two answers we have seen to your very nice question:\n",
      "1. An Eruv is not needed for carrying on Yom Tov even when it is not for a need of the day (Pshat #2 in the Ran; possibly Rav Chayim Kohen).\n",
      "2. An Eruv is necessary and sufficient to permit \"needless\" carrying on Yom Tov, but Rebbe still maintains that is not enough to classify carrying as an activity forbidden on Yom Tov to the degree that it will disallow creating an Eruv Chatzeros on Yom Tov for the next day Shabbos (Pshat #1 in the Ran; Rashi according to Tosfos; Rashba; Ra'ah).\n",
      "The Nafkah Minah being whether a person needs to make an Eruv Chatzeros for Yom Tov at all. Now I see that the Mishnah Berurah [1] actually tells us that this is a Machlokess between the Mechaber (who is lenient) and the Rema (who is stringent).\n",

      "#1) According to Rashi (12a), there actually is no Torah prohibition to carry for no need on Yom Tov. As such, we can more easily understand Rebbe's words view literally, i.e. carrying is completely Mutar. Accordingly, it is Mutar to make an Eruv Chaterzos for the next day which is Shabbos.\n",
      "#2) According to Tosfos, the case under discussion is actually when Yom Tov Rishon falls on Thursday, and you want use a Tenai regarding the Yom Tov Sheni of Galuyos to prepare it two days in advance. Rebbe forbids making an Eruv Techumin because it involves Kinyan, but not so Eruv Chatzeros (Tosfos later on [2]).\n",
      "Tzelach explains Rashi could not subscribe to #2, because he is Midayek that Rashi [3] believes there is a problem of Kinyan with Eruv Chatzeros as well; nor could Tosfos to #1, since Tosfos [4] hold that carrying for no need on Yom Tov is in fact Asur. \n",

      "Dear Sholem,\n",
      "Moadim l'Simchah! Good to hear from you. Very nice point! Baruch Hashem, I see the Ran writes along your very line of thought. He does, however, consider an alternative possibility, which might not have occurred to us. That is, it may be possible even without an Eruv Chatzeros, carrying items in a Chatzer is permitted even when they are not needed for Yom Tov. The reason being that since most carrying is permitted on Yom Tov (since it is l'Tzorech), therefore Chazal did not bother forbidding any carrying in a Chatzer, even that which is not needed for Yom Tov at all, since that is a minority case. I hope this helps. May you continue to attain greatness in Torah learning and Yiras Shamayim!\n",

The first Beraisa on the DAF refers to Yom Tov which falls on a Shabbat - why do we then follow him when it comes to Shabbat Rosh Chodesh/Chol Hamoed - it's a separate Beraisa and the gemara doesn't mention Rebbi at all...\n",

      "The second is that we Davka want to publicize the fact that it is Rosh Chodesh. (This brings to mind the statement of Chazal which the Rambam codifies [2] that says when Rosh Chodesh coincides with Shabbat, the Levi'im would recite the song for Rosh Chodesh instead of Shabbat.)\n",

One suggestion could be that since once Yom Tov ends there is no more opportunity to bring the Chagigah or Reiyah *at all*, therefore the concern \"Shema Ye'anes\" that he might not offer them during the following week, is enough to let the Chagigah and Reiyah assume the status of Zman Kavua which is permissible to offer on Yom Tov.

Why do we say that the laws of tumah apply to a Katan when usually halacha doesn't really apply to them (other than then through the father's obligation of chinuch) until they are a gadol? How would the child become tahor? Can they bring a Korban or would they have to wait until they are bar mitzvah? If they are a kohen, does that mean they can't eat terumah until they are a gadol?\n",

      "1. About 1000 years had passed since Ezra's time until the Talmud Bavli was recorded. During that time, perhaps some of the families with poor lineage migrated back from Eretz Yisrael to Bavel.\n",

Ezra never felt any need to remove these descendants of the Erev Rav because his goal was to avoid them mixing in to the Jewish marriage pool, and here there was no such risk, because the individuals dicussed in our Gemara were publicly known as low characters, and thus people knew to stay away.\n",
      "3. Ezra was only concerned with removing people who were illegitimate, e.g. Mamzer/Eved/etc. But, assuming the Erev Rav were legitimate converts, Ezra may have felt there was no need to remove them, since technically they are basically Kosher, since they are not Gerim, but only descendants of Gerim. \n",

      "ADDITION:\n",
      "Please let me add two comments related to the suggested resolutions we discussed.\n",
      "Regarding #1, as a mentor of mine Rabbi Rafi Braun pointed out, it may be difficult for us to say that just because so much time has elapsed, therefore some families might have come back, because the Gemara itself in the last Perek of Kidushin uses this assumption -- that Bavel is free of any Pesulei Yichus -- even as late as Talmudic times [1].\n",
      "Regarding #3, as someone kindly pointed out to me [2], the Rambam rules like the opinion in the Gemara that a descendant of Gerim \"loses\" that status -- at least in the sense that he cannot marry a Mamzeres (unlike the earlier descendants of those Gerim) -- after enough generations have passed that he no longer is identified as a Ben Gerim. \n",
      "By the way, a fourth suggestion might be that those wealthy families of Bavel didn't travel with Ezra to Eretz Yisrael because for some reason Ezra couldn't identify them (even though Rav was able to do so [3]!).\n",

Ezra never felt any need to remove these descendants of the Erev Rav because his goal was to avoid them mixing in to the Jewish marriage pool, and here there was no such risk, because the individuals dicussed in our Gemara were publicly known as low characters, and thus people knew to stay away.\n",
      "3. Ezra was only concerned with removing people who were illegitimate, e.g. Mamzer/Eved/etc. But, assuming the Erev Rav were legitimate converts, Ezra may have felt there was no need to remove them, since technically they are basically Kosher, since they are not Gerim, but only descendants of Gerim. \n",

      "Great to hear from you. I like your question. I see the Gemara in Berachos on Daf 24a clarifies that the Tefilin should not be placed directly under the head [1], and this would seem to be true even according to the opinion of Shmuel [2]. Once it is established that sleeping with one's head directly over the Tefilin is forbidden, perhaps we can better understand why Rashi cites the rationale that we are not angels [4]. Even though we are only human beings, and therefore during the course of sleep we might accidentally place our head upon the Tefilin, nevertheless Chazal did not oblige us worry about that possibility. This interpretation also would be reflected in the Ra'avad [3].\n",

Rashi seems to contradict a Mechilta on Shmos 12:16 that darshans an obligation to honor the chol hamoed with clothes and food. Fasting would seem to violate this.\n",
      "Menachem Weiman, St. Louis, United States>Shalom Menachem,\n",
      "Very good question! I see the Acharonim speak about this point. Maybe we can organize it as follows. The Kashya makes three assumptions:\n",
      "1) Rashi means literally that there is no problem to fast on Yom Tov (or Chol ha'Moed as you astutely pointed out).\n",
      "2) There is a prohibition to fast on Yom Tov in the day and in the night.\n",
      "3) There are no exceptions to that prohibition.\n",
      "I am aware of three answers, each of which will erase one of those assumptions above.\n",
      "Answer A) Rashi's language is to be taken with a grain of salt. He does't mean that we are allowed to fast on Yom Tov per se. He is just saying that with regard to Hilchos Sukah, there is no obligation to eat. This is the Pnei Yehoshua's first answer. And it fits with Tosfos' understanding on Daf 49 of Berachos.\n",
      "B) Rashi can indeed be taken literally, and he is saying it is OK to fast on Yom Tov. Only that this is permitted specifically at night. The prohibition to fast is only in the daytime. This is the Pnei Yehoshua's second answer.\n",
      "C) There is a prohibition of fasting on Yom Tov, but there is an exception if you had a bad dream the night before (see Shabbos 11a). In such a case, fasting is OK according to the Chachamim, but not according to R. Eliezer. This is Aruch la'Ner's answer.\n",

I will share this though: The Rambam writes the basis from which we learn the prohibition of an Arel to eat other Korbanos is in fact from the source written by Korban Pesach [1,2].  (Tosfos discussed a similar possiblity regarding the prohibition of an Onen to eat other Korbanos [3].) Also, if you have an opportunity to look in the Maasei Hamelech [4], I believe he discusses key points that revolve around your Kashyas. Perhaps most startling and significant for our discussion is his citation of the Yerushalmi [5], in which an objection (to a related Limud) is presented based on the law of not breaking bones which is unique to Pesach. \n",

      ">>Greetings for the new year!. What is the reason the Torah does not list the signs of kosher birds the way it does for fish and land animals as found in the Talmud in Chulin 59? And why does it name birds if the naming is unnecessary? Actually the same question could be asked about land animals.Since the Torah states that only animals that chew cud and have split hooves are kosher, why mention the pig and camel etc. which we know are not kosher?\n",
      "Thanks,\n",
      "David Goldman>It's great to hear from you! This is an excellent series of questions! Let me share with you the insights I came across. I hope you find them as interesting and helpful as I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a very relevant comment of the Chasam Sofer found in his Chidushim on this Daf (Chulin 59a, DH uv'Sefer Ma'ayan Chochmah). He is addressing the question of why the Torah does not provide the four Kashrus signs for Ofos even though the Torah does provide the two Kashrus signs for Chayos and Behemos.\n",
      "\n",
      "To answer this, he suggests that only regarding Ofos could Chazal readily be relied upon to infer the correct signs, which they did by examining the crucial differences between the Tor (Tahor) and the Nesher (Tamei). The reason this was possible, the Chasam Sofer maintains, is because any other minor discrepancies between the two catgories of Ofos (e.g. different color) can easily be dismissed as inessential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding Chayos and Behemos, on the other hand, the Chasam Sofer believes that the Torah could not have relied on Chazal to infer the signs merely based on the identity of the species. The reason for this is because there are too many other discrepancies between Tahor and Tamei mammals apart from chewing their cud and possessing split hooves. As such, Chazal would not have been able to confidently discount all those non-relevant features (e.g. possessing horns/antlers, or having certain orientation of the flesh).\n",
      "\n",
      "Many Mefarshim discuss the issue of whether the Kashrus signs of animals are a \"Sibah\" (i.e., they are actually what causes the creature to be Tahor or Tamei; see Ritva to Nidah 51b, DH Yagdil), or the Kashrus signs are just an indicator, a \"Siman,\" of whether a creature belongs to either the Tahor or Tamei group (see Teshuvos Maharit #51). The Mesitva edition (in Yalkut Bi'urim on this Daf) cites many views.\n",
      "\n",
      "One opinion perhaps most relevant to your discussion is that of the Rogatchover Ga'on (Tzafnas Pane'ach, Hilchos Ma'achalos Asuros 1:1) who maintains that regarding mammals the two Kashrus signs are the Sibah, but regarding birds the four Kashrus signs are only a Siman.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would be reflected in the fact that the Torah mentions the signs for mammals, but not for birds. Accordingly, we can understand why the Torah named the species of Ofos. Regarding the mammals, the most straightforward reason why the Torah mentions the camel, pig, etc. seems to be to dispel the thought that they might be Kosher despite the fact that they have one Kosher sign.\n",

      "Mefarshim explain that Chazal are trying to teach us the following. A person has a temptation to commit a sin. He should realize that he is not just some unimportant individual. Rather, he -- like Adam ha'Rishon -- is capable (hypothetically) of producing a vast multitude of children which could comprise an entire world. \n",
      "If so, then he will view himself as an important individual. This will motivate a person to generally act according the high level of dignity and importance that he bears. See Ohr l'Yesharim on Yerushalmi 4:9 DH Kol Echad. \n",
      "Moreover, it will promote him to forgo a sinful choice that would bring ruination upon himself by committing the Aveirah. See Rashi 37a DH Bishvili, who is also cited by Tosfos Yom Tov 4:5 DH Lefikach, Yad Ramah 37a DH Lefikach (second Peirush), and Korban ha'Eidah on the Yerushalmi 4:9:1. \n",
      "Moreover, since the individual has the potential to produce many offspring, if he will succumb and commit the Aveirah, that will bring downfall not only to himself, but also to all those offspring who could emerge from him. Indeed, this is similar to Adam who, as a result of his sin, brought about significant degradation not only to himself but to all of mankind that descended from him. See Tiferes Yisrael on the Mishnah in Yachin 4:39.\n",
      "Alternatively, what's meant is not that one particular individual person is the reason for the world, but rather that mankind is the center the creation, and thus all other creatures were designed and made for our sake. If so, then each living person, who was so privileged to be given his or her own existence as a human being, must feel gratitude and therefore thank Hashem for making all the amenities of this world for our benefit. See Yad Ramah's first Peirush (ibid).\n",

      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Shalom,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. This is not a Psak Halachah.\n",
      "1) \n",
      "I believe I see from the first question an assumption there may be a difference between Jews and gentiles regarding payment for damages. In a significant way, that is quite right. \n",
      "a) \n",
      "For example, Chazal teach us that a Jew doesn't have to pay if his ox gores a gentile's ox, whereas if the gentiles ox gores the Jew's ox then the gentile does have to pay (Bava Kama 37a). Likewise, according to Rav Yosef's explanation of Rebbe Akiva, there is no prohibition of stealing from a gentile if he is not a Ger Toshav (Bava Kama 113b). \n",
      "b) \n",
      "But these cases seem to be the exception rather then the general rule which is that payment for damages to a gentile are no different than those to a Jew. Support for this premise can be found in the Yerushalmi (Bava Kama 4:3) in which two Romans didn't find any \"objectionable\" monetary laws in the Torah other than these two we mentioned. Furthermore, even though the Gemara (Bava Kama 38a) proves from Pesukim that Hashem permitted the money of gentiles (Rebbe Avahu learns this from Chabakuk 3:6; alternatively Rebbe Yochanan learns it from Devarim 33:2), nevertheless Tosfos (Bava Kama 38a DH Amad) understands that this \"permission\" would only apply to the cases we mentioned above, i.e. the goring ox and -- arguably -- Gezel Akum, but not to other cases of property damage. \n",
      "c)\n",
      "You asked about a Ruach Metzuyah. The Gemara (Bava Kama 60a) says that when a wind caused the fire to spread, then the person who started the fire is Patur. Tosfos (DH Libah) maintains that this is only if the wind is Einah Metzuyah. But if the Ruach is Metzuyah, then he must pay. This is Paskened in Choshen Mishpat 418:9.\n",
      "2) Halachah follows the Chachamim (as opposed to Rebbe Yehudah) who hold that Tamun b'Eish is Patur. But that is only when the fire was lit, let's say, in the yard of the Mazik. If, however, the fire was lit in the yard of the Nizak, then the Mazik must pay, if the Tamun items are normally expected to be stored inside whatever was enclosing them (Bava Kama 61b; Choshen Mishpat 418:13).\n",
      "There are many more details here that we didn't even discuss. But for the time being, I hope this helps as a start!\n",

      "ADDITION:\n",
      "I see a bit more about the subject now, and I believe the following this would also interest you.\n",
      "1) Capital Punishment for Murder b'Mezid\n",
      "It appears from Rambam (Rotzeach 2:11) that the law is the same regarding a Jew who murders a Ger Toshav or murders a Goy. In both cases, there is no punishment administered by the Beis Din. See Kesef Mishnah who cites as the source of this ruling the Mechilta of Rebbi Yishmael (21:14 DH Ish) which discusses the alternative punishment from heaven.\n",
      "2) Cities of Refuge for Murder b'Shogeg\n",
      "Moreover, the Torah (Bamidbar 35:15), the Mishnah and Gemara (Makos 8b), and the Rambam (Rotzeach 5:3-4) teach us that the cities of refuge provide protection for a Ger Toshav who b'Shogeg kills another Ger Toshav. Vis a vis your question, it is important to note that this priviledge is *not* afforded to a Goy who worships idols.\n",
      "2) If the Gentile is Murdered b'Shogeg\n",
      "On the other side of the coin, the Minchas Chinuch (410:1 DH she'Nitzavu) cites a Machlokess reagrding whether there is a difference between an Akum and Ger Toshav when they are the victims of murder at the hands of a Jew who kills him b'Shogeg. Rambam (ibid. Halachah 3) writes that the Jew is *exiled* to the Ir Miklat if he kills a Ger Toshav b'Shogeg. The Rahamach agrees with the Rambam. The Ra'avad disagrees, as does the Kesef Mishnah who even maintains that the Girsa in the Rambam must be a mistake.\n",

      "When a person does Teshuvah, Hashem draws him close with love, and happily accepts that person's good deeds (Rambam, Teshuvah 7:6-7).\n",
      "Teshuvah and Yom Kippur can *suspend* the weight of a sin that carries a penalty of Kares. But in order for a person to achieve full atonement, it is necessary to undergo suffering (Yoma 86a; Rambam, Teshuvah 1:4). \n",
      "I would like to note that it doesn't say what type of suffering. It may not have to be physical. Moreover, one would be tempted to suggest that a regimen of serious Torah study may enable a person skip to the need for more uncomfortable types of suffering. The reason for this could be twofold: first, the intense and disciplined study of Torah may be a valid way to \"inflict oneself\" with the requisite dose of \"suffering\"; secondly, Talmud Torah is generally known to provide protection (Berachos 5a; Sotah 21a; and many other sources). In fact, \n",
      "Minchas Chinuch (M.C.) discusses a number of technical details related to your question (Mitzvah 364). For example, in section 14 he discusses whether the suffering is necessary applies for a *Lav* that was Kares (the view of the Tosefes Yom ha'Kipurim 85b), or even for an *Aseh* that was Kares (the view of the M.C. himself based on the Rambam).\n",
      "Furthermore, in section 17, M.C. tries to demonstrate -- perhaps surprisingly -- that there is no difference between Shogeg versus Meizid with regard to this atonement procedure. He also concludes that if the sin included a penalty of lashes, and the individual received those lashes, then he doesn't need Yom Kippur nor additional suffering in order to atone for this particular sin. \n",
      "Lastly, in sectino 22, M.C. discusses which components actually make a contribution toward achieving the atonement. For example, is it all based on the suffering? Or does the Teshuvah -- alone or together with observance of Yom Kippur -- help somewhat to provide the suspension as well. \n",

      "In case of Chitim/Seorim [1], Reuven demands $100 payment for an alleged sale of wheat to Shimon. Shimon disagrees and instead maintains that he owes only $80 to Reuven for a sale of barley.\n",
      "On the surface, it would seem that although the claims contradict each other, still Shimon should pay $80 m'Mah Nefshach. Yet the Halachah is not so. Instead, Shimon is Patur entirely, i.e. he doesn't even have to pay for the alleged barley. Why is that? \n",
      "The Beis Yosef (Choshen Mishpat 88:12) cites three views: first, Rashi and Tosfos who maintain that it is because Reuven was *Mochel* the money for the barley; second, the Rosh who maintains that it is because Reuven was *Modeh* that he never gave barley to Shimon; third, the Ramah who believes it is because Shimon's Hodaah regarding the barley is not considered an official admission.\n",
      "I believe that the key point for us, however, is that there is a Nitva, Shimon, who is denying the Chiyuv to pay for the Toveya's claim of wheat. This is not like our case of the woman. For until she spoke up, she was presumed to be married and as such was enititled to receive Mezonos from the husband's estate. No one denies that. It is she alone who declared herself to be divorced. If we would believe her, then she should be entitled to receive the whole Kesubah payment right away. \n",
      "But we can't believe her, since she doesn't bring testimony of two witnesses. Therefore, she cannot receive her Kesubah payment all at once; because any day her husband may show up and deny ever having divorced her. Instead, she simply continues receiving Mezonos, *her right to which no one denies*. But, of course, this is permitted only until her collection reaches the value of the Kesubah, which was the limit she alone imposed on herself by her claiming to be a divorcee. \n",

But an angreement or commitment that is enforced only by a vow or oath is, in a very significant sense, something almost purely between the individual and Hashem; typically there's not a whole lot that the other party can do at all in order to coerce the obliged individual fulfill his duty even, if that duty is to provide some service for the other party.\n",

The question is equally applicable to ulla and to abaye and rovo (bottom of 28b)   they are only arguing about the pidyon after ketztiza. But before ketzitza everyone agrees that you have to keep being podeh, again and again.\n",

      "Shalom,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. Baruch Shekivanta! This point hinges on an important dispute amongst the commentaries. Some actually maintain that Ula does not agree to Bar Pada regarding the automatic resanctification after the saplings are redeemed (The Ran in his second explanation on 28b DH veha'Chacham ha'Gadol). According to this, we can understand why the Gemara on 29b-30a only tries to resolve the question of Rav Hoshaya based on Bar Pada, and not based on Ula. \n",
      "But others believes that Ula agrees to Bar Pada, like you appear to be assuming in your question (see the Ran 28b DH v'Kasav ha'Rashba). See the Rosh at the bottom of 29b who explains that indeed Ula would agree, but we are just mentioning Bar Pada's name because he is the one who spoke out this Halachah.\n",

      "Great to hear from you.\n",
      "You are raising an interesting point! I would like to share a couple of ways of looking at the Gemara's discussion, according to which this issue might be alleviated somewhat. \n",
      "First, it may sound far fetched, but it is possible be that the gentiles picked up on this garlic eating custom of ours because they enjoyed it or found it beneficial.\n",
      "But secondly, and perhaps more to the point, is that the Chidush being taught in our Mishnah is not in the Diyuk, that you *are* permitted to benefit from a gentile who eats garlic. But rather the Chidush is in the second case which is stated, i.e. that you are *not* allowed to eat from a Kusi who eats garlic. The reason why this is a Chidush is because, l'Maskanah, it is only a person who is eating garlic *because of the decree of Ezra* that is included in the Neder prohibition. Now, the Kusim only kept *some* Halachos meticulously -- typically those of the written Torah, but *not* of the oral Torah. Nevertheless, in the case of Ezra's enactment to eat garlic, they *were* careful to keep it. \n",
      "Now, recall the Machlokess Tanaim regarding whether the conversion of the Kusim was valid, simply based on the fear of lion attacks. If we go with the premise that the Kusim are legitimate converts, then they not only *observe* this garlic Takanah, but they are also are *obliged* to do so. That is why they are included in the Neder prohibition. So, according to this interpretation, the focus is not really on the admittedly unlikely case of a gentile who eats garlic on Friday night, but rather on the case of Kusi.\n",

      "Shalom R' Gray,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. I appreciate you raising this question. It gave me an opportunity to research and think about this subject to a degree; and I am glad to share what I found. But, in case you are in a hurry and don't have time to read it all, I invite you to skip to section 6 below, which is where I personally feel your question is best addressed.\n",
      "1) The Rosh's Kashya\n",
      "I see Mefarshim ask a different but related question; namely: Rather than learn from Moshe's words by the episode of Korach (16:29), why doesn't Reish Lakish instead learn from the Posuk \"Yeilchu Vah\" (Shemos 18:20), since that is where Chazal elsewhere (Bava Kama 100a; Bava Metzia 30b) derive the obligation of Bikur Cholim. See the Perush ha'Rosh (Nedarim 39b DH l'Bikur). \n",
      "2) Differentiating from Your Question\n",
      "Your question comes from a different angle, based on another statement of Chazal (Bava Metzia 86b) in which Hashem is understood to have visited the sick Avraham Avinu after his Bris Milah (Bereishis 18:1). \n",
      "3) The Rosh's own Terutz\n",
      "The Rosh, in any event, suggests the following answer, which some consider as being hard to accept (see section 4 below). He writes that the reason is because the Posuk of Yeilchu Vah is *not explicit*, but the reference in the Posuk by Korach *is* explicit. The Rosh himselfs notes the difficulty with this in terms of Reish Lakish's language in the Gemara, which is \"Remez\". The Rosh evidently understands that the term Remez means an explicit reference. \n",
      "4) Maharatz Chayes\n",
      "The Maharatz Chayes (Nedarim 39b) takes issue with this, though, because we find other examples (which he lists there) of what Chazal refer to as a Remez to various laws even though they are not at all explicit. (By the way, he also notes the significant discussion between the Rambam and Ramban (Sefer ha'Mitzvos Shoresh #3) whether the status of laws based on Remez is that of a Torah level.)\n",
      "5) Two Suggestions\n",
      "In terms of your question, though, it would seem to me at this point there are two possible initial thoughts even if they are not full answers. \n",
      "a) Explicit versus Implicit\n",
      "The first thought would be, if we accept the Rosh's view above, to say that arguably it is *more explicit* when Moshe says that people visit one another when deathly ill (as the Tosfos and Ran explain Pshat in our Gemara), and less explicit when Hashem is interpreted as having appeared to Avraham as a measure of Bikur Cholim after his Milah, since the latter is not openly stated in the Torah but rather inferred. But in a sense, this would be difficult to suggest, since -- as the Maharsha points out -- the literal context of the Posuk by Korach is not really Bikur Cholim. Rather, as I would understand it to mean, it's referring to the hypothetical option \"if the fate of all mankind befalls them (i.e. natural death)\". We interpret the phrase to refer to visiting the sick only because of a Drashas Chazal.\n",
      "b) Emulating G-d versus Personal Obligation\n",
      "A second thought would be this: The story of visiting Avraham only teaches us that visiting the sick is a worthy -- and even divine -- activity; but not necessarily is it a unique Mitzvah unto itself. This, however, is also may not be 100% convincing, because we are in fact obliged to emulate G-d's ways, concerning which Chazal indeed cite Bikur Cholim as a prime example (Sotah 14a based on Avraham)!\n",
      "6) Torah Mitzvah versus Rabbinic Mitzvah\n",
      "a) \n",
      "The two suggestions above, therefore, to my mind, are speculative and not well enough substantiated, when compared to the following which I personally find to be the most appealing answer. \n",
      "b) \n",
      "I see cited the Perush of Rabbi Avraham Min ha'Har, who explains that Reish Lakish is *not* seeking the source that there is a Mitzvah d'Oraisa to visit the sick. Rather, Bikur Cholim is only a Mitzvah d'Rabanan, which Chazal instructed us to perform, because it involves the Jewish values of kindness and caring for a person in need etc. Accordingly, our Gemara is not at all trying to locate a Posuk which teaches us that it is a proper activity to visit the sick. (If it were, then as you asked, we should prove it from Hashem visiting Avraham.) \n",
      "c)\n",
      "Rather, the Gemara is trying to showing that this practice was something that Jews regularly performed, even without being obliged by a Takanas Chazal. If so, then we can understand very well why the Gemara chose to cite Moshe's speech by Korach rather than the case of Hashem visiting Avraham. For the former expresses the fact that Bikur Cholim is an activity that Jewish people regularly do; whereas the latter, while it's certainly a noble act of benevolence, to be sure, nevertheless it is an act performed by ha'Kadosh Baruch Hu, *not* people in the Jewish community.\n",
      "7) Rambam\n",
      "By the way, the Rambam (Avel 14:1) adopts the view that the Chiyuv to visit the sick is rabbinic, but still they are included in the Torah adage and obligation of \"Love your fellow as yourself\" (Vayikra 19:18). It might be argued that this is a case of the phenomenon -- which appears elsewhere as well -- of a Chiyuv Mitzvah that is mid'Rabanan (Bikur Cholim) which involves a Kiyum Mitzvah that is mid'Oraisa (v'Ahavta l'Reiecha Kamocha).\n",

      "Great to hear from you.\n",
      "You are asking an excellent question. I see the Minchas Chinuch (M.C.) offers a number of explanations why that gentile was given capital punishment.\n",
      "1) Because stealing is one of the seven Noachide commandments (Sanhedrin 57a; Rambam, Hilchos Melachim 9:9), and this gentile stole a portion of the Korban Pesach. This is based on Rashi (Kidushin 52b DH Ki and Bava Kama 12b DH Aval) who maintains that a Korban even after being slaughtered is still Mamon Gavoha. Only a Jew -- who has a right to eat it -- may partake; but for a gentile who has no such right, taking part would constitute theft (M.C. 14:2 DH Ohd).\n",
      "2) The opinion of some Rishonim (e.g. the Semag; and possibly the Rambam) is that when a gentile eats from the Korban Pesach, he himself is violating the prohibition (Shemos 12:45) \"Toshav v'Sachir Lo Yochal Bo\". According to this view, it can be argued that this Isur is binding on a gentile even though it is not listed as one of the seven Noachides commandments. The reason being either because this prohibition a) is *not* applicable at all times, or b) is *not* applicable in all places, or c) *is* written openly in the Torah (M.C. 14:1-2). \n",
      "3) Possibly, when the Chachamim investigated this gentile, they discovered that he was in violation of any number of the seven Mitzvos, and it was for those that he deserved the death penalty. This is like the answer the Ramban (Bereishis 34:13) suggests regarding why Shimon and Levi were entitled to kill out the inhabitants of Shechem (M.C. 14:2 DH u'Lechorah).\n",
      "I hope this helps!\n",
      "Warmest regards,\n",
      "Yishai Rasowsky\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "ADDITION:\n",
      "I wanted to share a couple of additional points with you:\n",
      "A) Some Mefarshim take a totally different approach and maintain that the prohibition for which the gentile was liable the death penalty was that of entering the Azarah. See the comment of the Netziv in his Meromei Sadeh (DH Badku). This could be a problem because of the gentile's bodily Tumah, and/or because there was a law of the king (Hordos for example) that forbade a gentile from entering too far into the central areas Har Habayis.\n",
      "B) Some suggest that the gentile was guilty of \"stealing\" from the Jewish members of the Chaburah with whom he ate. See Rav Elchonon Wasserman in his Kovetz Shiurim (#6). Other point out that this Terutz will not necessarily hold up if we assume the goy *paid* fair and square for his portion. This is because there are Rishonim who maintain that by paying for an item that actually takes away the Isur Gezel (see Tosfos in Bava Kama 62a Chamsan and in Sanhedrin 25b DH m'Ikara). But others argue, and hold that there is still an Isur Gezel even if the \"thief\" pays (view of the Ri Migash). It may be that only according to the latter view would the Cheshbon of the Netziv remain solid. See Rav Shmuel Rozovsky in Chidushei R' Shmuel (#30).\n",
      "C) As I alluded to in the previous message, not all Rishonim agree to the premise that a gentile himself is violating the law of \"Toshav v'Sachir Lo Yochal Bo\" when he eats from a Korban Pesach. According to some, it is only the Jew who is violating that Mitzvah. In that case it would be debatable whether the Jewish people could take the life of a gentile, in order to facilitate the Jews' observance of the this law. \n",

      "Avraham Sacks  asks:\n",
      "\n",
      "Why would the Kohen Gadol need a reminder from the linen sheet that the avodah of the day is with linen clothing? Is there a deeper meaning?   \n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Kollel replies:\n",
      "Shalom R' Sacks,\n",
      "Great to hear from you.\n",
      "1) The Need for a Reminder\n",
      "The basic understanding -- which I also see in the Mefarshim -- is that he should not wear the wrong set of garments by mistake. As far as commentaries who say that there is a deep symbolic meaning, and that the linen alludes to something spiritual, I would suggest looking at the Ramban on the Torah (Vayikra 16:4) who writes that the concept of wearing the special garments of this particular material is based on the lofty idea of heavenly divine service and Lavush Bodim mentioned in Yechezkel 9:3 and Daniel 10:5. \n",
      "2) The Kashya of the Rishonim\n",
      "I can, however, share with you what I did find. That is, the commentaries are bothered why Rav Kahana -- who explained why the linen sheet was used (\"so he should recognize that today's service is in linen garments\") -- originally made his comment on the *second* occurrence of immersion in the Mishnah. Ostensibly he could have -- and should have -- explained it the same way on the first occurrence of immersion that appears earlier in the Mishnah!\n",
      "3) The Terutzim of the Rishonim\n",
      "I see two main opinions amongst the Mefarshim: Ritva, which most people would probably find easier to understand; and Tosfos. \n",
      "a) Ritva\n",
      "The Ritva believes that the reason why Rav Kahana mentioned his explanation for the linen sheet on the *second* immersion is because at the second immersion he's taking off his golden garments and *putting on his linen* garments. So the rationale of having a reminder to wear linen makes sense, since that is the set of garments which he is about to put on next. In the beginning of the Mishnah, however, the reason does not really apply, in terms of pure logic, because the garments he is going to put on are *gold, not linen*! Yet, the Ritva maintains, Rav Kahana's reason is still true, since once the law of using a linen sheet was enacted for immersion #2, so Chazal say they should use the linen sheet for immersion #1 as well (Lo Plug).\n",
      "b) Tosfos\n",
      "The explanation of Tosfos is, in a sense, the exact opposite; namely: The reason why Rav Kahana offered his explanation for the linen sheet on the *second* immersion instead of on the first immersion is because by the *first* immersion it's *obvious* that they need to use a linen sheet, in order to remind him to not get mixed up and use the wrong garments (see below for more about this). At the *second* immersion, on the other hand, Rav Kahana felt a need to state his explanation, since by immersion #2 it is *not* obvious why they should need to use the linen sheet. There are two reasons why it's not obvious, as follows. \n",
      "Reason #1: Obviously after immersion #2 he is going to put on the linen garments, and he doesn't need the linen sheet as a reminder, because there would be no concern that is going to put on the gold garments, for immersion #2 is after having just taking those gold garments off! \n",
      "Reason #2: They already raised the linen sheet by immersion #1. So arguably that could suffice as the only reminder needed for the whole day. Thus a linen sheet by immersion #2 would be superfluous.\n",
      "4) The Kashya on Tosfos' assumption\n",
      "There is a question that the later commentaries ask on this Tosfos. That is, how can it be necessary to remind him to wear linen at the first immersion? At the first immersion, he puts on gold garments, not linen! I saw in Mesivta two main approaches to answer this question. One is from the Siach Yitzchak, and the other is from the Nezer ha'Kodesh.\n",
      "5) The Terutzim of the Acharonim\n",
      "a) \n",
      "The Siach Yitzchak follows the premise that there are two sets of white garments (Michnasayim, Ketones, Avnet, and Mitznefes). One set is made of plain linen (\"Bod\"). These are worn all year -- including Yom Kippur -- whenever the Kohen Gadol wears his \"gold garments\" (Meil, Ephod, Choshen, and Tzitz). In addition, there is a set of fine linen (\"Bootz\") garments used just on Yom Kippur when doing the Avodas Penim which is without any gold garments. According to the Siach Yitzchak's interpretation of Tosfos, the purpose of the sheet of \"Bootz\" on the first immersion is to remind him that when he wears his golden garments he should *not* wear them with the \"Bootz\" garments, but rather with the \"Bod\" garments -- the symbolism of the \"Bootz\" sheet being that whenever the \"Bootz\" garments are worn, they are to be worn alone, not with gold.\n",
      "b)\n",
      "The Nezer ha'Kodesh explains Tosfos differently: He adopts the premise that Avnet of Kohen Gadol worn all year round was made not only of linen but of Shaatnez, i.e. wool and linen together (see Yoma 5b-6a). But his Avnet for Yom Kippur was made purely of linen. The linen sheet at the first immersion was to remind him to wear the linen Avnet instead of the Shaatnez one. \n",

      "\n",
      "I am familiar in Bava Basra 31a where the case of two men inheriting the same land from their fathers is addressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we know that Beis Din has the duty to argue all possible claims for the litigants (as compared with secular court judges). An example of this is in the Tallis case on Bava Metzia 2, Beis Din seems to deduce that they grabbed it at the same time, despite that not being their claims, and they construct an oath consistent with their claims in accordance with that deduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I innocently ask if the Gemara considers a possible resolution to deduce that these two men must be half brothers who were unaware of each other's existence!\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, what ends up being the relevance of each man claiming the plural form of 'fathers'? Perhaps it implies several generations of rolling forward ownership within the lineage? And accordingly if there were two separate families with a common father, it could have been a few generations ago, and the men could be first, second, third, cousins through half brothers generations back. Absent no other way to reconcile their claims, why couldn't Beis Din congratulate them on their family reunion (at least provided the house was exempt from being split - like the example of a too-small room I think)?\n",

      "Shalom R' Chaim,\n",
      "Great to hear from you.\n",
      "I believe your question involves two distinct principles of Chazal. The first principle is to make a Chalukah if there is a chance it could be true, as we do by the Talis in Bava Metzia 2a, even if the Chalukah contradicts the litigants claims. I see that Tosfos (Bava Metzia 2a DH v'Yachloku) maintains that this principle only applies when neither party is holding onto the item *and* neither party bears any evidence which the other doesn't also have. Here, though, only one party is currently Muchzak; and each party has a distinct type of support which the other party does not have.\n",
      "The second principle is to make a claim on behalf of the Muchzak in order to enable him to keep the property he is holding, as Beis Din does for Yesomim in Bava Basra 41a. I understand that this only applies when the Muchzak is not contradicting the claim we'd make for him. See for example Tosfos in Bava Basra 31a DH Mah. Now, this is a new discussion to me, because I had not thought about your question before, but here, it sounds to me like the Muchzak is saying the land belonged to *only* his fathers, i.e. and not to the fathers of the Miarer.\n",
      "I hope this helps to distinguish why those principles do not relate to our case. But you'll please let me know if any point remains unclear, or if some part of your analysis escaped my attention. Thanks!\n",

      ">>A question has come up in connection with my chavrusa on Chumash Bereshis and I am hoping you can help us. We were learning the pasuk 1:29 in which Rashi explains that Hashem made man and animals equivalent in that they were not given permission (before the time of Noach) to eat animals, but rather were allowed to eat every green herb together. The Ramban on this posuk seems to disagree with Rashi in terms of the types of allowed vegetable matter for animals and humans. He writes that Hashem gave to Adam and Chava all the grasses that give seeds and all the fruit of the trees. To the animals and the birds, He gave every green herb but not the fruit of the trees and not the seeds. \n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, our question is : why does the Ramban disagree with the Rashi about the interpretation of this posuk, and what is (are) the reason(s) that the Ramban makes a differentiation between man and animals in terms of the types of vegetable matter that they were allowed to eat?\n",

      "\n",
      "The weakness the Ramban identifies with Rashi's explanation is the following grammatical point. If, as Rashi maintains, verse 30 is not just permitting vegetables to animals, but is actually adding them to the list of already permitted foods (seed herbiage and fruit of the tree, mentioned in verse 29), then there should be a conjunctive \"and\" (a letter Vav) placed before the permission of vegetables in verse 30. Since there is no Vav, the Ramban understands the two verses to be separate.\n",

      "Though I did not yet come across what I find to be a definitive answer, one is nevertheless tempted to suggest the following reasons to distinguish the order employed in the Mishnah versus that of the Gemara:\n",
      "In the Mishnah, the laws are simply being listed succintly. Therefore, perhaps the Tana chose to list Shofar before Lulav in order to fit with the chronology of those Mitzvos in the calendar, i.e. Rosh Hashanah comes before Sukkos. \n",
      "Alternatively, the Tana wanted to place Hallel next to Lulav, and not next to Shofar, because there is a Mitzvah Hallel on Sukkos but not on Rosh Hashanah.\n",
      "In the Gemara, however, the focus is on the scriptural sources which are being provided. Therefore, there is more reason to list the verses according to the order in which they appear in the Torah. The Posuk for Lulav appears in earlier Sefer Vayikra, whereas the Posuk for Shofar appears later in Sefer Bamidbar. \n",
      "I realize, however, that more explanation would be required to justify the order of the other laws and sources in this Sugya.\n",
      "Just to add another dimension to the discussion of the fascinating point you raised, I want to share with you that I noticed the Rabeinu Chananel who cites the Yerushalmi as presenting the scriptual sources for these laws in yet  another order; namely: Megilah, Hallel, Shofar, Musaf, Tefilas Musaf, Lulav, etc.\n",

      "When he says he wants to bring a Minchah of lentils, it is relatively more obvious that he is Chayav to bring a wheat Minchah. The reason is because his words contained a glaring error. No one, after all, would actually think that a Minchah can be made from lentils. So, based on the premise that he must have intended something coherent, we can only assume that he was attempting to retract from his original commitment to bring a Minchah. But, in fact, he is not able to retract; therefore, he certainly remains Chayav to bring a Minchah. \n",
      "If, on the other hand, he says he wants to bring a Minchah of barley, it is relatively less obvious that he is Chayav to bring a wheat Minchah. The reason is because his words contain only a slight error. One could potentially be unaware that a Minchah should not be made from barley. But if so, then there is no reason to assume that he meant to commit himself to anything other than what he actually said, i.e. a barley Minchah.

      "Some writers assume that the Shekel here weighs around one half of a modern day ounce. If so, then the total weight would be around 100 ounces, which is over 6 pounds. \n",
      "But this is not taking account of Chazal in Tanchuma (Vayera 4 and Reeh 4) whom the Malbim (II Shmuel 14:26) cites. They point out that when a Shekel is mentioned in Navi, it means a Litra. Incidentally, Rashi in Eruvin (29a DH Ukla) tells us that a Litra is a Log. But one should be careful not to get confused between units of weight and units of volume. In any event, if one Litra weighs around 12 ounces, or 0.75 pounds, then according to this view the hair weighed about 150 pounds, which is a staggering amount. \n",
      "Josephus (The Antiquities of the Jews 7:8), writing almost two millenia ago, tells us that the hair weighed 5 pounds. Based again on the premise that a pound from Josephus's time is equal to 12 modern day ounces, that would translate to a total weight of around 3.8 pounds.\n",

      "Chazal seem to have been sensitive to the issue of failing to see the forest for the trees, and they express the danger of losing track of the bigger picture if one spends great effort focusing on the numerous finer details. \n",
      "My Chavrusa, R' Tzvi Lesman, pointed out that in Makos 24a Chazal recount how various leaders tried to \"reduce\" the vast number of specific Torah laws -- 613 -- down to a smaller number of simpler, more basic guidelines. For example, David reduced them down to 11, Yeshayau down to 6, Michah down to 3, etc. \n",
      "This could be understood as expressing the idea that it is easier for a person to manage a brief list of principles that are more general, i.e. the forest, rather than try to keep track of hundreds of applications, i.e. the trees. This may, however, not be the understanding of Rashi, since he explains (DH v'He'emidan) the reason why the number of laws was reduced: Because the previous generations were more righteous than the later generations, and if the latter individuals would try to keep all of the laws they would not succeed; therefore they were given a shorter list of guidelines so that their task should be more manageable. So, it might be argued that this concern is different than missing the forest for the trees; since the latter usually refers to the understanding a subject matter, rather than the performance of a great number of tasks.  \n",
      "Perhaps even more relevant, there are additional sources in Chazal which indicate that the act of study in particular should first be done with an emphasis on the broad overview, and only subsequently to focus on individual details. One is in Shabbos 63a, which says that a person should first learn a lot of material, and only subsequently think into it. Rashi (DH d'Ligmar Inish and DH v'Hadar Lisbar) explains this to mean that one should absorb the content from his teacher, even without understanding the rationale behind it, and only subsequently should he analyze the reasons behind the teaching. \n",
      "Another statement of Chazal on this very subject is found in Avodah Zarah 19a. There Rava makes the point that a person should first learn the material and only later contemplate it. Rashi (DH Yilmad Adam and DH v'Achar Kach Yehgeh) explains this to mean that a student should first be fluent in the whole teaching, and only later start to make comparisions and raise challenges. \n",
      "In fact, Rashi offers two reasons for this: one is because he might spend so much time on the analysis that when he finally is ready to learn more material his teacher may not be available; Rashi's second reason -- and I suspect this is closer to the phenomenon of missing the forest for the trees -- is that once the student learns a large enough amount of material, then many of his questions will be resolved on their own. \n",
      "Finally, the Gemara in Berachos 63b teaches that one should first quietly listen to the material of a given lesson, even if there are difficult portions to understand, and only later raise challenges and arrive at resolutions. \n",
      "So, these three sources can be understood as telling us that if we try to analyze subtlties before getting the larger view of the subject, then we risk getting bogged down in details, misunderstanding the points, etc. \n",
      "You expressed the idea that any statement which is true must have a source in Chazal. It does say in Pirkei Avos (Ben Bag Bag's statement at the end of chapter 5) that we should repeatedly go over the Torah since we can find everything in it. From there it does appear that there is a Torah source for virtually everything. \n",
      "Moreover, the Gemara in Sotah 4b -- citing Tehilim 25:14 -- relates that a Chacham may be privy to certain information since Hashem reveals His secrets to those who fear Him. But I believe this is actually not a source to prove that all truths are found in the Torah or in a statement of Chazal, since here the information is specially dispensed to one Tzadik, and it is not found somewhere in the Tanach or Mesorah.\n",
      "On the other hand, Eichah Rabbah 2 teaches us that if someone tells you there is wisdom amongst the Goyim, then you can believe him. Furthermore, the Gra on Mishlei (beginning of chapter 6) expresses the thought that a Talmid Chacham can be fluent in the whole of Torah, and yet might be missing some knowledge of wordly wisdom. These sources might be interpreted to mean that there are some truths about the world that are not necessarily easy to infer from purely Torah sources. \n",

      "\n",
      "A question has come up in connection with my chavrusa on Chumash Bereshis and I am hoping you can help us. We were learning the pasuk 1:29 in which Rashi explains that Hashem made man and animals equivalent in that they were not given permission (before the time of Noach) to eat animals, but rather were allowed to eat every green herb together. The Ramban on this posuk seems to disagree with Rashi in terms of the types of allowed vegetable matter for animals and humans. He writes that Hashem gave to Adam and Chava all the grasses that give seeds and all the fruit of the trees. To the animals and the birds, He gave every green herb but not the fruit of the trees and not the seeds. \n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, our question is : why does the Ramban disagree with the Rashi about the interpretation of this posuk, and what is (are) the reason(s) that the Ramban makes a differentiation between man and animals in terms of the types of vegetable matter that they were allowed to eat?\n",

      "Just for convenience, I will translate Eisev Zorea Zera (1:29) as \"seed herbiage\" and Yerek Eisev (1:30) as \"vegetable\".\n",
      "Suppose we consider verses 29 and 30 together as a unit. There are two groups of creatures being given permission to eat: human beings and animals. And there are three categories of food that are being permitted for consumption: seed herbiage, fruit of the tree, and vegetables. \n",
      "According to Rashi, The two verses are to be understood as a collective whole. Hence, all three food categories are being permitted to both groups of creatures. \n",
      "The Ramban argues and maintains that each verse should be considered on its own. Verse 29 permits only human beings to eat seed herbiage and fruits of the tree. And verse 30 permits only animals to eat vegetables.\n",
      "The weakness Ramban identifies with Rashi's explanation is the following grammatical point. If, as Rashi maintains, verse 30 is not just permitting vegetables to animals, but is actually adding them to the list of already permitted foods (seed herbiage and fruit of the tree, mentioned in verse 29), then there should be an conjunction \"and\", i.e. a letter Vav, placed before the permission of vegetables in verse 30. Since there is no Vav, Ramban understands the two verses to be separate. \n",
      "Commentaries challenge the Ramban, however, since the Torah itself later (9:3) refers to the permission that mankind was given to consume vegetables. See Mizrachi.\n",
      "Commentaries also defend Rashi by saying that the term for vegetable in verse 30 is really a more expansive term that includes both the seed herbiage and the fruit of the tree mentioned in verse 29. See Gur Aryeh.\n",
      "You astutely asked, according to Ramban, why should there be a distinction between which food types are permitted to man versus animals. On one level, we can say the Ramban is just following the distinction that he found in these two verses, which were divided by the Torah itself. But, of course, that just pushes the question back one step further. \n",
      "I do see, however, that the Seforno also learns like Ramban, not like Rashi. And from his words we *might* be able to infer a partial explanation for why the Torah made this distinction. Seforno writes that the type of vegetables which are permitted to animals are not seed bearing. I am tempted to suggest that since man engages in the enterprise of sowing and harvesting, whereas animals just eat what they find, without intentionally planting seeds, therefore it may be fitting to assign the two distinct food categories to each respective group of creatures.\n",

Perhaps childlessness is to someone a greater ill, or one should wish to avoid both.  What segula is there to answer perhaps for all sides?\n",

      "Thank you for sending you the link to the terrific Shiur. Yes, I heard, from 34:40 until 35:30, that Rav Elefant cites Mefarshim who teach that a Segulah for preventing poverty is to daven in a Shul. Since you mentioned Tefilah b'Tzibur, I will just mention that the Rav added, if I heard him correctly, that this virtuous practice is advised even if there is no Minyan available. \n",
      "I hear you are asking for Segulos that will help overcome not just poverty but childlessness, which is by no means any less of a difficult hardship. It is a very important issue you are raising. This is a terribly distressing issue for many couples. I came across a number of suggestions, and though it is not for me to rank them, I will try to list them roughly in order, beginning with those which seemed most traditional. I believe that many of the items I will mention you are already aware of, so forgive me for that; but I hope that some of the ideas are new.\n",
      "1. Tefilah. In Yevamos 64a, Rebbi Yitzchak explains: Why were our Avos originally unable to bear children? Because ha'Kadosh Boruch Hu desires the prayers of the Tzadikim. Hashem may withhold children from a person for many years because He wants the individual to strive in prayer. \n",
      "2. Seeing a fertility doctor. Many treatments are available today, and I know indivduals who have waited 8 or 10 years, but with great Siyata d'Shamaya they were blessed with healthy babies after a series of treatments. Bonei Olam is an organization that helps with the financial aspect of these treatments. Their website is https://www.boneiolam.org.\n",
      "3. Davening for *another* person. Chazal say that if we daven for someone else who has the same hardship, i.e. they are also childless, then Hashem grant us the Yeshuah first. The Gemara (Bava Kamma 92) learns this from Avraham who prayed for Avimelech and subsequently Sarah was granted a son even before Avimelech was healed. There is a wonderful organization called Kol ha'Mispalel which operates on this principle; they anonymously match up pairs up indivuduals who are undergoing the same Tzarah to daven for each other. I believe they can be contacted by email at connect@kolhamitpalel.com or by phone at 646-294-4355. Another organization based on the same idea can be found at the website https://davenforme.org/.\n",
      "2. Observing the Mitzvah of Neros, as Rav Huna says (in Shabbos 23a): ha'Ragil b'Ner will have sons who are Talmidei Chachamim.\n",
      "3. After a woman lights Shabbos candles, she can recite the Haftarah of the first day of Rosh Hashanah. This is from Shmuel chapter 1 which tells the story of Chanah's struggle being without any children until the eventual birth of Shmuel (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 72:2).\n",
      "4. Perform the Mitzvah of Hachnasas Orchim, providing hospitality for guests. The Midrash says this is a merit for which Sarah Imeinu and the Shunamis woman were each blessed with a child (Midrash Tanchuma, Ki Teitzei 2).\n",
      "5. Being the Kvater at a Bris (Otzar ha'Bris 12:9).\n",
      "6. I also see other suggestions in the name of Rav Moshe Shternbuch (see Teshuvos v'Hanhagos 1:790): the husband can bathe in very cold water before intimacy; ask a Kohen to mention one's name before he performs Birkas Kohanim; ask a Mohel or Sandak to pray before a Bris; recite Pitum ha'Ketores from a Klaf twice a day; to fast on four separate days; and to change one's name.\n",

      "Great to hear from you.\n",
      "The Gemara you cited which requires mentioning Yetzias Mitzrayim is referring to Kiddush recited at night. \n",
      "We know from 106a that Kiddush at night -- as opposed to the morning -- is the main obligation of Kiddush. The reason for that is, as Rashi writes (106a DH Ein Li Ela Bayom), because night is when Shabbos comes in. Consequently, once a person was Yotzei having mentioned Yetzias Mitzrayim at the nighttime Kiddush, he doesn't have to do so again in the daytime Kiddush. \n",
      "The Gemara you cited calls it \"Yom\", even though it is in fact referring to what is recited at *night*, because \"Yom\" refers to the entire day of Shabbos, not *day* in the sense of \"daytime\". I can share a couple of other places where the Gemara uses the term Kiddush *Hayom* even though it is referring to the nighttime Kiddush. One is in Pesachim 102a. The other is Rashi (DH Midi d'Hava a'Kidusha) on Kesuvos 7b.\n",

      "I now see that the commentary Menachem Meishiv Nefesh explains the meaning of the Rashi you cited as follows. Earlier, we had been discussing the bull of the Kohen Gadol, which is positioned between the Heichal and the Mizbeach. If it's backside were facing eastward, that would be a problem, since it would point towards the Mizbeach. At this later stage of the Gemara, however, where Rashi says the backside is facing eastward, we are discussing Kodshei Kodashim (as Rashi writes in DH Keitzad Someich and DH Omeid b'Tzafon). These are Korbanos which have to be slaughtered in the portion of the Azarah that is to the north of the Mizbeach. If so, we understand that the backside of the animal facing to the east would actually not be a problem. Since it would not point towards the Mizbeach. Rather, the Mizbeach would be to the left of the animal (to the south), not behind the animal (to the east). \n",

      "From the Gemara and Rashi (38a DH b'Shimcha and 38b DH u'Mishelcha), the simple explanation seems to be the following. A person might fear that their livelihood are in jeopardy. Someone else, for example, a competitor, might pose a threat to take their income away. Yet the truth is that a person's Parnasah is predetermined by Hashem; he will receive what he deserves without having to worry about impositions from other people. \n",
      "In the case of Beis Garmu and Beis Avtinas, they might have been tempted to worry that someone else would be awarded their position; that is, unless they reveal their secret, which in their eyes would have constituted an impropriety. Why, ultimately, did their job security remain intact? Because, even though they refused to reveal their secret to the Chachamim, Hashem arranged nevertheless that no competitor could exactly duplicate their services. It was only because of this Hashgachah that the Chachamim -- as you correctly wrote -- were compelled to reinstate them. \n",

This is unlike the Ba Litaher who indeed receives a boost of divine assistance to strive further in the righteous direction.\n",

      "Greetings for the new year!. What is the reason the Torah does not list the signs of kosher birds the way it does for fish and land animals as found in the Talmud in Chulin 59? And why does it name birds if the naming is unnecessary? Actually the same question could be asked about land animals.Since the Torah states that only animals that chew cud and have split hooves are kosher, why mention the pig and camel etc. which we know are not kosher?\n",

      "Shalom R' Goldman,\n",
      "Great to hear from you. This is an excellent series of questions! Let me share with you the insights I came across. I hope you find them as interesting and helpful as I did.\n",
      "There is a very relevant comment of the Chasam Sofer found in his Chidushim on this Daf (Chulin 59a DH ub'Sefer Maayan Chochmah). He is addressing the question of why the Torah does not provide the four Kashrus signs for Ofos even though the Torah does provide the two Kashrus signs for Chayos and Behamos. \n",
      "To answer this, he suggests that only regarding Ofos could Chazal readily be relied upon to infer the correct signs, which they did by examining the crucial differences between the Tor (Tahor) and the Nesher (Tamei). The reason this was possible, the Chasam Sofer maintains, is because any other minor discrepancies between the two catgories of Ofos (e.g. different color) can easily be dismissed as inessential. \n",
      "Regarding Chayos and Behamos, on the other hand, the Chasam Sofer believes that the Torah could not have relied on Chazal to infer the signs merely based on the identity of the species. The reason for this is because there are too many *other* discrepancies between Tahor and Tamei mammals apart from chewing their cud and posessessing split hooves. As such, Chazal would not have been able to confidently discount all those non-relevant features (e.g. possessing horns/antlers, or having certain orientation of the flesh).\n",
      "Many Mefarshim discuss the issue of whether the Kashrus signs of animals are a \"Sibah\", i.e. they are actually what causes the creature to be Tahor or Tamei (see Ritva Nidah 51b DH Yagdil); or are the Kashrus signs just an indicator, or \"Siman,\" of whether a creature belongs to either the Tahor or Tamei group (see Shu\"t Maharit #51). Mesitva in Yalkut Beurim on this Daf cites many views. \n",
      "One opinion perhaps most relevant to your discussion is that of the Rogatchover Gaon (Tzafnas Paneach, Maachalos Asuros 1:1) who maintains that regarding mammals the two Kashrus signs are the Sibah, but regarding birds the four Kashrus signs are only a Siman. \n",
      "This would be reflected in the fact that the Torah mentions the signs for mammals, but not for birds. Accordingly, we can understand why the Torah named the species of Ofos. Regarding the mammals, the most straightforward reason why the Torah mentions the camel, pig, etc. seems to be to dispel the thought that they might be Kosher despite the fact that they have one Kosher sign. \n",

      "Great to hear from you!\n",
      "As you might know, the courtyard of the Mishkan -- which housed the Shechinah in the Midbar, Gilgal, Shiloh, Nov, and Givon -- was surrounded by curtains. This is where the term Lifnim Min ha'Kelaim comes from. Once the Beis ha'Mikdash was built in Yerushalayim, however, there were actual firm walls surrounding the Azarah. \n",
      "Commentaries address the reason why the Mishnah nevertheless uses the term from the period of the Mishkan, instead of a term such as \"Lifnim m'Chomos ha'Azarah\" that would appear to be more \"up-to-date\" and -- as you astutely pointed out -- would be more consistent with the language of the Mishnah elsewhere which discusses \"Kol Makom *ba'Azarah*\".\n",
      "Some say it a throwback to the original version of the Mishkan in the Midbar which was in fact the context where the laws regarding the location for eating the Korbanos were given (see Bartenura Zevahim 5:3 DH Lifnim, which is based on Vayikra 6:9).\n",
      "Interestingly enough, others point out that even in the Beis ha'Mikdash itself, while the walls had not yet been built, the Korbanos would be consumed inside the Azarah only once a series of temporary curtains were set up around it (Meleches Shlomo, Zevahcim 14:8).\n",
      "Still others answer your excellent question by saying that the Tana of the Mishnah chose to mention the curtains of the Mishkan simply because Zevachim 14:4 discusses the Mishkan (Tosfos Yom Tov, Zevachim 5:6 DH b'Kol Makom).\n",
      "Moreover, the Tiferes Yisrael (Yachin Zevachim 5:24) offers two answers: First, that eating Kodshei Kodashim is permissible anywhere inside the boundary of where the surrounding curtains would have stood, which includes even inside the Heichal itself (e.g. if there was not enough room in the Azarah). Shechitah, however, l'Chatchilah must be done in the actual Azarah, and not in the Heichal. (But, as the Tiferes Yisrael himself points out, be aware that the Rambam in Maaseh ha'Korbanos 5:4 who b'Diavad validates even Shechitah that was performed in the Heichal.)\n",
      "His other explanation is because the Tana, in this Perek particularly, which contains no Machlokess, wished to be faithful Davka to the language in which Moshe Rabeinu orginally taught us, i.e. the Lashon of curtains frmo the days of the Mishkan.\n",
