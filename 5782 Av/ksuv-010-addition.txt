Kesuvos 010: Rain and Dates

Rabbi Wagner <Semicha5765@yahoo.de> asks:

B"H

Shalom,

I know this is a hard question, but do you have an idea why suddenly the gemara starts to speak about the rain, and dates.

I mean on a deeper level. I understand that they started with Rav chana from Bagdath on the name almana and then carriedmon with additinal sayings by him, but why exactly those????

The Kollel replies:

Shalom Rabbi Wagner!
Good to hear from you. I appreciate your thoughtful question. In my search, I didn't yet find Mefarshim who substantively connect the statements about Almanah, rain, and dates. 
Therefore, I feel at a loss, because I believe it would be too much of a stretch to simply suggest, for example, that they all pertain to fertility (i.e., a wife tries to bears children, the rain provides water for crops, and dates are Peiros that provide us nourishment).
I do see, however, that the Sefer Toldos Tanaim v'Amoraim notes Rav Chana Bagdata's expertise in produce, which might contribute to the attention he pays to not only dates (as that Sefer notes, based on our Daf) but also rain. 
If it provides any consolation, at times, Rashi himself notes the citation of apparently unrelated statements together in the Gemara just because they are from the same author. 
Still, I would say that your expectation to find a link is legitimate, since other Mefarshim will at times elaborate on the more substantive connection. I believe that Maharsha and Ben Yehoyada are normally good places to look for this, but here I did not see them speak up about it.
In any event, in case you are interested, Leib Moscovitz pointed out to me two secondary sources that might possibly help:
a) a list of Rashi and Rashbam's comments on such cases, which appears in David Rosenthal's article in Mehqerei Talmud 1, p. 201 and following; and 
b) such lexical-exegetical passages in the Gemara generally, which are expounded upon in p. 171 ff. For a specific reference to the passage you mentioned, check p. 176 ff.
By the way, an example of a somewhat similar phenomenon comes to mind; and that is, some Rishonim maintain that the subject matter of Taharos will be discussed even when it doesn't relate to the mainstream topic, since it was mentioned in passing and we lack a Gemara devoted to the Masechtos of that Seder. This view is found in Rashi in Sukkah (14a DH Mishum). 
In addition, as you know, the Gemara frequently says that a teaching was brought in order that we should infer an novelty "by the way" (Milsa Agav Orchei, notwithstanding the apparent lack of any substantive link between the two subjects. 
A quick search reveals that this phenomenon appears in the following Gemaras: Kidushin 69a regarding ascent to Israel; Sukkah 21b regarding the casual conversation of Torah scholars; Bava Kama 2b regarding an ox who gores people or animals; Beitzah 40a regarding animals drinking before being slaughtered; Eruvin 104a regarding usage of a medicinal reed in the Mikdash on Shabbos; Rosh Hashanah 15a regarding people damaging an Esrog tree by touching it; Nedarim 25a regarding the required structure of an olive press beam.
I know this is not the sort of answer you were wishing for, but I hope it at least helps give some context to the phenomenon.
Best wishes,
Yishai Rasowsky

ADDITION:
Yasher Koach to Rabbi Shmuel D. Berkovicz who shared with us the Peirush from a Sefer called Toras ha'Agadah. He in fact suggests the follwoing thematic link between the statements of Rav Chana Bagdata. The term for an Almanah is a reference *to the future* Takanas Chazal. So too, suggests the Toras ha'Agadah, the subsequent explanations from Rav Chanan Bagdata are related to the future: Rain produces no immediate change in the soil, but still provides nutrients and vitality for the produce which will eventually grow later on. Likewise, the benefits conferred by dates last into the future, since their nutrients remain in the body for a long time. 
I hope this helps!
Best wishes,
