Yoma 036: The Zevach stands in the north side facing the west

Avraham Sacks <asrbs13@gmail.com> asks:

Shalom,
The Braisa says that the korban stands in the north with its face toward the west.  Rashi writes: with its back to the east.  How can the animal be positioned with its back to the east after the Gemarra already mentioned the bull needed to be positioned north to south and not west to east because there is a decree lest the animal defecate opposite the mizbeiach? 
Thank you for your help,
Avraham Sacks

The Kollel replies:
Shalom,
Great to hear from you.
You are making an excellent point. The Meiri also indicates that the hind quarters of the animal face west which, as you astutely pointed out in Rashi, is difficult to understand in light of the Gemara's concern earlier about defecation. I must keep an eye out for someone who offers more explanation for this interpretation. Meanwhile, there are some Mefarshim -- namely, Rabeinu Elyakim and Sfas Emes -- who maintain that the hind quarters should be facing *north*.
I hope this helps!
Warmest regards,

ADDITION:
I now see that the commentary Menachem Meishiv Nefesh explains the meaning of the Rashi you cited as follows. Earlier, we had been discussing the bull of the Kohen Gadol, which is positioned between the Heichal and the Mizbeach. If it's backside were facing eastward, that would be a problem, since it would point towards the Mizbeach. At this later stage of the Gemara, however, where Rashi says the backside is facing eastward, we are discussing Kodshei Kodashim (as Rashi writes in DH Keitzad Someich and DH Omeid b'Tzafon). These are Korbanos which have to be slaughtered in the portion of the Azarah that is to the north of the Mizbeach. If so, we understand that the backside of the animal facing to the east would actually not be a problem. Since it would not point towards the Mizbeach. Rather, the Mizbeach would be to the left of the animal (to the south), not behind the animal (to the east). 
I hope this helps!
