Then it also says in the Zohar more people who don't leave gehinom. So what do we mean when we say everyone has a chelek in olam haba/leaves gehinom   except for categories which seem to contradict?Thank you and have a great dayNati raymond, United Kingdom----------------------------------------------The Kollel replies: Shalom Nati,The topic you are asking about is very deep and has lots of sources to be learnt thoroughly. I think the right way to start off, is to learn the third chapter of Hilchos Tshuvah of the Rambam, where he makes different lists and categories. The default of every Jew is that he has a part designated for him, and only him, in what is called 'Olam ha'Bah. Unfortunately, when a person sins, he can definitely lose his part. The Rambam first brings the 24 types of people who do not have a part in Olam ha'Bah at all. These is pretty much the same list in Perek Chelek in Sanhedrin. He then goes on to bring another list of people who are mentioned in different places in Chazal, (including Bava Metzia 58), and says that these sins, can cause a person to lose his part in Olam ha'Bah if he commits them regularly. Let me just note, that there is a big discussion in the Rishonim regarding Ba Al Eshes Ish, since the Gemara (Bava Metzia 59) says that this person, although killed by Beis Din, he still does have a Chelek in Olam ha'Bah. The Rambam concludes that people on both lists, can always do Tshuva, and get there Chelek in Olam ha'Bah back. There is an opinion in Rabeinu Bechaye (va'Yikra 18;19) that all these who are mentioned in the Mishna as those who lose their Chalek, this is only their personal part in Olam ha'bah, but they still have a Chelek which is given to them as Tzedaka even if they do not deserve it. There are also different opinions what the concept of 'Yordim le'Gehenom ve'Einam Olim'. Iv'e seen in the past some who say that since if these will go inti Gehenom they will have no way to exit, there are different kinds of punishments like Gilgulim or of the sort. I am not sure what Zohar you mean. Do you have a reference? In some case (like Giluy Arayos) we find that a person can lose his chelek in Olam ha'Bah not only in the Zohar. In others, it can hint to something conceptual.I hope this helps,Aharon Steiner
