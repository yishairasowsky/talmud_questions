Menachos 034: Tefilin

Davic1 <davic1@verizon.net> asks:

Greetings. All the psukim related to remembering the Torah that appear in the Torah and in Mishlei are metaphorical referring to keeping the Torah in one�s mind all the time � yadecha, zichron, oys, etc. etc. It is only in one case where specifically oys and totafos refer to tefillin. But even if we say that there is both the metaphorical meaning (according to Rashbam) in addition to the asmachta for tefillin, we cannot say that the tefillin correspond to wearing them all the time the way a person is supposed to remember the Torah all the time. In fact the Torah itself nowhere states the duration of wearing them.

Why do we need an asmachta in that posuk for tefillin when they are anyway halacha leMoshe miSinai in all their aspects, and given the fact that wearing them does not even correspond to the literal/metaphorical meaning of constantly keeping the Torah as a sign in ones actions and one�s thoughts?

In addition, �beyn eynecha� does not really exist, so what does this contribute except in a purely metaphorical way (the space between the eyes is maybe half an inch at most), especially since miSinai tefillin are worn at the top of the forehead, which has nothing to do with �between the eyes�?
It would make more sense to connect tefillin with the head as �totafos al roshecha� as an asmachta.

Thanks,
David Goldman

The Kollel replies: 
Dear R' David,
Great to hear from you. I appreciate your meaningful comments and questions about the source in the Torah from which we learn Tefilin. 
The Mitzvah of Tefilin is learned from the verses, but as you correctly pointed out, the features are learned from Oral Tradition [1]. 
In Tanach (e.g. Devarim 14:1) the phrase "between your eyes" is not literal, but rather it means in the middle of the head, in the place where the hair grows [2,3,4].
Interestingly, the commentaries discuss the idea about what allegories may [5] or may not [6] be interpreted in the Mitzvah of Tefilin.
I hope this helps. May you continue to attain greatness in Torah learning and Yiras Shamayim!
Best wishes,
Yishai Rasowsky
